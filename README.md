Python & Pie 2015: Taylor Swift Twitter Bot
===========================================

This is a bot I taught a "tutorial" about for Python & Pie 2015 (an orientation
SatCo for incoming Freshman).  It simply responds to any @-mention with a
randomly chosen Taylor Swift lyric.

- The bot was originally deployed as `@pypie15bot` on Twitter.  The original
  version is no longer deployed.

- You can find the tutorial (that used to be the README) in
  [tutorial.md](tutorial.md).

- You can find the library I wrote and used to download all of Taylor Swift's
  lyrics [here](https://github.com/brenns10/tswift) - or just `pip install
  tswift`.

**Note:** I decided to do some further development on this bot.  I have left
this repository intact with the original code and tutorial.  The new version is
named [@pyswizzle](https://twitter.com/pyswizzle) and its updated code is
[here](https://github.com/brenns10/pyswizzle).
