Python & Pie 2015: Taylor Swift Twitter Bot
===========================================

This is a bot I taught a "tutorial" about for Python & Pie 2015 (an orientation
SatCo for incoming Freshman).  It simply responds to any @-mention with a
randomly chosen Taylor Swift lyric.

- You can find the bot deployed (as of now) on Twitter
  [@pypie15bot](https://twitter.com/pypie15bot).

- You can find the tutorial (that used to be the README) in
  [tutorial.md](tutorial.md).

- You can find the library I wrote and used to download all of Taylor Swift's
  lyrics [here](https://github.com/brenns10/tswift) - or just `pip install
  tswift`.
