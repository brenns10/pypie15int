Python & Pie 2015-2016: Taylor Swift Twitter Bot
================================================

This is a simple Twitter bot that responds to tweets with randomly chosen Taylor
Swift lyrics.

A more sophisticated version is on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pyswizzle),
[Github](https://github.com/brenns10/pyswizzle).

You can follow the [tutorial](tutorial.md) for 2015 or look at the
[slides](http://brennan.io/talks/2016/08/07/python-and-pie/) from 2016.

You can find the library I wrote and used to download all of Taylor Swift's
lyrics [here](https://github.com/brenns10/tswift) - or just `pip install
tswift`.
