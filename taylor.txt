You were what I wanted when I wanted what I just couldn't have
You were country lovin' really somethin' for three months and a half

Everybody said that you were bad news
but baby I was betting on you

So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving to pay back
Now I'm gonna have to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
But you weren't even worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

I said let them say we're crazy, you said let's go fishing a lot
The midnight moon was blazing baby, I was gazing into your eyes

Everything changed when you took me to town
Caught you staring every other girl down

So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving to pay back
Now I'm gonna have to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
But you weren't even worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

Can't believe the time you lost me
Can't believe what it cost me

Cause I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big ol serving to pay back
I had to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
You ain't never been through that
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

7 years and 50 days, the time is passing by
Nothing in this world can be as nice as you and I
And how could we break up like this?
And how could we be wrong?
So many years, so many days and I still sing my song

Now I run to you like I always do
When I close my eyes I think of you
Such a lonely girl
Such a lonely world
When I close my eyes I dream

I return to you like I always do
When I close my eyes I think of you
Such a lonely girl
Such a lonely world
When I close my eyes I dream Of you

7 years and 50 days, now just look at me
Am I the girl I use to be
So damn what do you see?
And how could we break up like this?
And how could we be wrong?
So many years, so many days and I still sing my song

Now I run to you like I always do
When I close my eyes I think of you
Such a lonely girl
Such a lonely world
When I close my eyes I dream

I return to you like I always do
When I close my eyes I think of you
Such a lonely girl
Such a lonely world
When I close my eyes I dream Of you

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello

Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, please, don't go

And I said,
"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby just say yes

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me, I was begging you, please, don't go

And I said Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say yes

Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby just say "Yes"

Oh, oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said
"Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"

He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby just say yes"

Oh, oh,
Oh, oh

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you.



Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart?
Now, why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

Maybe I shouldve seen the sign
Shouldve read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes
That I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say, I still cant believe
That you would walk away, it dont make sense to me

But why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart?
Now, why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

Its not unbroken anymore
How do I get it back the way it was before?

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart?
Now why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break?
Why would you wanna break a?

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart?
Now why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?



I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road
I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one, who feels
The way I do

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own
And that's all I know,
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl
Trying to find a place in this world

Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need?
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
But that's okay

[Chorus]

Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
But I'm ready to fly

I'm alone, on my own
And that's all I know
Oh, I'll be strong, I'll be wrong
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm alone, on my own
And that's all I know
Oh, I'm just a girl
Trying to find a place in this world

Oh, I'm just a girl
Oh, I'm just a girl, oh, oh
Oh, I'm just a girl



I walked through the door with you, the air was cold,
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house,
And you still got it in your drawer even now.

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze.
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate.
The Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place,
And I can picture it after all these days.

And I know it's long gone,
And that magic's not here no more,
And I might be okay,
But I'm not fine at all.

'Cause there we are again on that little town street.
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over me.
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well.

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red.
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-size bed
And your mother's telling stories about you on a tee ball team
You tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me.

And I know it's long gone
And there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night.
We dance around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah.

Maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much,
And maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up.
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well.

Hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise.
So casually cruel in the name of being honest.
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well.

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it, 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well



(Hey hey hey)
(Hey hey hey)
(Hey hey hey)
(Hey hey hey)
People like you always want back the love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed
The more I think about it now the less I know
All I know is that you drove us off the road

Stay, hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay

Here you are now, calling me up, but I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made
People like you always want back the love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye

Stay, hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay (Stay, stay, stay)

Let me remind you this was what you wanted (Oh oh oh)
You ended it
You were all I wanted (Oh oh oh)
But not like this
Not like this
Not like this
Oh, all you had to do was stay

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy (All you had to do was stay)
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay (Oh)
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay (Ooh)



Sometimes I wonder
How its gonna feel
Will my first love be true and real
Will I be ready when
My heart starts to fall
What will I do when my love comes to call

And my daddy tells me
That I light up his world
Everyday he says "Darlin,
You're my best girl"
He tried to teach me
From the very start
The meaning of love
So nobody breaks my heart

Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in the pourin' rain?
Am I ready for the joy?
Am I ready for the pain?
Am I ready for the boy?
Am I ready for love?
For love

I know I'm not a little
Girl anymore
Cuz I'm feeling things
I've never felt before
Sweet sensations
And anticipations
Calling commotion
To my emotions

And I hear the words
My daddy says to me
He said "be true to yourself
And keep your spirit free
And love will find you
One way or another
Be good to yourself
And be good to each other"

Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in the pourin' rain?
Am I ready for the joy?
Am I ready for the pain?
Am I ready for the joy?
Am I ready for the pain?
Am I ready for love?

Its a run around the world
And its moving so fast
Though I wanna find
A love thats gonna last
A love so strong
That it can withstand
The weight of the world
In the palm of its hand

Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in the pourin' rain?
Am I ready for the joy?
Am I ready for the pain?
Am I ready for the boy?
Am I ready for this game?
Am I ready for the kiss?
Am i ready for the stars?
Am I ready for the bliss?
Am I ready for love?



American boy, living life as it goes
Sittin' on the fence posts
Living in the lie
American boy, living in the real world
Trying just to get the girl
Trying to survive

Chorus:

The simple things in life are always new
growing up on Sam Hill avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
the greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
the hope of an american boy

Living off of bar tips, trying for relationships
looking for the love
Suddenly rise, an american beauty
suddenly he cheats, sent from above

Chorus:

The simple things in life are always new
growing up on Sam Hill avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
the greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
the dream of an american boy

American boy, raising little babies
hearing daddy maybe, I'll be like you
Suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn
that's grown up, american boy

Chorus:

The simple things in life are always new
growing up on Grandview avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
the greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world will ever once destroy
No, nothing in the world will ever once destroy
the hope of an american boy



Well, she was an American girl
Raised on promises
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life
Somewhere else

After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if she had to die trying
She had one little promise she was gonna keep

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

Well, it was kind of cold that night
She stood alone on her balcony
She could see the cars roll by out on 441
Like waves crashing on the beach

And for one desperate moment there
He crept back in her memory
God, it's so painful
It's something that's so close but still so far out of reach

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

Oh yeah, all right
Let's take it easy baby
And make it last all night
Oh yeah, all right
Let's take it easy baby
Oh, let's take it easy now

Oh yeah, all right
She was an American girl



I like the way you wanted me
Every night for so long baby
I like the way you needed me
Every time things got rocky

I was believing in you
Was I mistaken do you mean
Do you mean what you say
When you say our love could last forever

(Chorus)
But I'd rather you be mean than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth than have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow

I like the way you'd hold me
Every night for so long baby
I like the way you'd sing to me
Every time things got rocky

I was believing in you
Was I mistaken do you say
Do you say what you mean
When you say our love could last forever

(Chorus)
Cause I'd rather you be mean than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow

(Bridge)
You would run around and lead me on forever
While I stay at home still thinking we're together
I wanted our love to last forever

(Chorus)
But I'd rather you be mean than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow
Baby don't you break my heart slow



I'm so glad you made time to see me.
How's life, tell me how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while.
You've been good, busier then ever.
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why.

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind.
You gave me roses and I left them there to die.

So this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night.
And I go back to December all the time.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.
I go back to December all the time.

These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving,
When your birthday passed and I didn't call.
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I'd loved you in the fall.
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind.
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye.

So this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night.
And I go back to December all the time.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind.
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right,
And how you held me in your arms that September night,
The first time you ever saw me cry.
Maybe this is wishful thinking,
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right.

I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand.

But this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night,
And I go back to December.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December turn around and make it all right.
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind.
I go back to December all the time all the time

'Cause I, I

I want to be everything you need
I want to be where

You're here
Your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes

Just as long as you're mine
I'll be your everything tonight
Let me love you, kiss you
Baby, let me miss you

Let me see your
Dream about
Dream about
Dream about your eyes
Eyes, eyes, beautiful eyes



Nick: Yeah!!!

Miley: Woah!!

I know this isn't what I wanted
I never thought it'd come this far
Just thinking back to where we started
and how we lost all that we are

Nick: We were young and times were easy
But I could see it's not the same
I'm standing here but you don't see me
I'd give it all for that to change
And I don't want to lose her
I don't wanna let her go

Both: Standing out in the rain
Need to know if it's over
'cause I will leave you alone
Flooded with all this pain,
Knowing that i'll never hold her,
Like I did before the storm

Miley: Before the storm

Nick: With every strike of lightning
Miley: Comes a memory that lasts
Both: Not a word is left unspoken,
as the thunder starts to crash

Miley: Maybe I should give up
Miley & Nick: I'm standing out in the rain,
I need to know if its over,
cause I will leave you alone.
Flooded with all this pain,
Knowing that i'll never hold her,
Like I did before the storm

Miley: Trying to keep the light from going in

Nick & Miley: And the clouds from ripping out my broken heart.
We always say a heart is not whole without the one,
who gets you through the storm.

Standing out in the rain, knowing that it's really over
Please don't leave me alone, flooded with all this pain,
knowing that i'll never hold you, like I did before the storm

Miley: yeah

Nick & Miley: Like a did before the storm



Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do

Walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

You said you never met one girl
Who had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

And we walked down the block to my car and I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies that your family watches
Every single Christmas and I want to talk about that
And for the first time what's past is past

'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months

Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again



All is quiet in the world tonight
Counting stars and fireflies
This summer sings a lullaby
Of just me and my baby

On the hood of his daddy's car
Pass around his old guitar
Bet mama's wondering where we are
Just me and my baby

The world is spinning 'round
'Cause of just what I found

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
'Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

Driving home by the riverside
Wishing I could slow down time
Faking pictures in my mind
Of me and my baby

The car pulls up and I'm home too late
We didn't take that interstate
The back road was a better way
For me and my baby

The closer that we get
Ooh, I can't leave yet

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
'Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

Both know what we found
So we turned that car around

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Ooh, and be with my baby
Ooh, yeah and be with my baby



You're on the phone with your girlfriend
She's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room
It's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do'

But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up
And find that what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you can see I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me
You belong with me

Walkin' the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey isn't this easy

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say your fine
I know you better then that
Hey what you doing with a girl like that

She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up
And find that what what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you can see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know
Baby, you belong with me
You belong with me

Oh, I remember you drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're about to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
I think I know where you belong
I think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time
How could you not know
Baby you belong with me
You belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me



I lived down the street
In a broken down house
A car up on blocks in the driveway
The moment we meet
There was never a doubt
That we won't forget this Sunday

It's starts with a smile
And a walk in miles
And it all leads to this
Our first kiss

And all my friends are sayin'
"Girl, what are you thinkin'
You're better off
You're better off without him,

Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off
You're better off without him"
Well, they can talk forever
they just don't know better.

We drive around town
In a rusty old truck
Somehow it feels like we're flyin'
Don't wanna come down
But they make it so tough
Just evey one we know is tryin'

To push us a part
Hidden down in our hearts
And they get what they want
'Cause your gone

All my friends are saying
"Girl, why are you crying'
You're better off
You're better off without

"Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off
You're better off without him"
Well, they con talk forever
They just don't know better

You come to my door
In the pourin' rain
We know what we don't have to say
You hand a rose
And a note that says,
"We don't have to do things their way."

And all my friends are sayin'
"Girl, what are you thinkin'
You're better off
You're better off without him,

"Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off
You're better off without him"
Well, they can talk forever
they just don't know better.



Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer
And, I had it all; I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you could say sabotage
I never saw it coming, nor would I have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever present frown is a little troubling
And, she thinks I'm psycho
'Cause I like to rhyme her name with things, but
Sophistication isn't what you wear, or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh they didn't teach you that in prep school
So it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him, but I'll always get the last word
Whoa

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

And do you still feel like you know what you're doing,
'Cause I don't think you do, oh
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause
C'mon show me how much better you are
See you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say sabotage



Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, want to play?
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king baby I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait the worst is yet to come, oh no
Screaming, crying, perfect storm
I can make all the tables turn
Rose gardens filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)
But I've got a blank space baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over

I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

Ever thought about losing it
When your money's all gone and you lose your whip
You might lose your grip when the landlord tell ya that you're due for rent
And the grass so green on the other side
Make a n**** wanna run straight through the fence
Open up the fridge bout twenty times
But still can't find no food in it
That's foolishness
And sometimes I wonder, why we care so much about the way we look
And the way we talk and the way we act
And the clothes we bought, how much that cost?
Does it even really matter?
'Cause if life is an uphill battle
We all tryna climb with the same ol' ladder
In the same boat, with the same ol' paddle
Why so shallow? I'm just asking
What's the pattern for the madness
Everybody ain't a number one draft pick
Most of us ain't Hollywood actors
But if it's all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all can ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
Sincerely yours, from one of y'all

I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

I can feel your pain, I can feel your struggle
You just wanna live, been everything so low
That you could drown in a puddle
That's why I gotta hold us up, yeah hold us up
For all the times no one's ever spoke for us
To every single time that they play this song
You can say that that's what Bobby Ray wrote for us
When the tides get too high
And the sea up underneath get so deep
And you feel like you're just another person
Getting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleed
Uh, because we won't be near yet, both of us
But we still stand tall with our shoulders up
And even though we always against the odds
These are the things that have molded us
And if life hadn't chosen us
Sometimes I wonder where I would've wound up
'Cause if it was up to me, I'd make a new blueprint
Then build it from the ground up, hey
But if it's all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all can ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
From Bobby Ray, to all of y'all

I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us



I see your face in my mind as I drive away,
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people,
And sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time

Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie,
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down,
Now I don't know what to be without you around

And we know it's never simple,
Never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,

[Chorus]
And I can't,
Breathe,
Without you,
But I have to,
Breathe,
Without you,
But I have to

Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
People are people,
And sometimes it doesn't work out,
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out

And we know it's never simple,
Never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,

[Chorus]

It's two am
Feelin' like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy,
Easy for me

It's two am
Feelin' like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy,
Easy for me

And we know it's never simple,
Never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me

I can't,
Breathe,
Without you,
But I have to,
Breathe,
Without you,
But I have to

Breathe,
Without you,
But I have to

Sorry (oh) sorry
Sorry sorry
Sorry sorry



Here you are now, fresh from your wars
Back from the edge of time
And all that you were, stripped to the bone
I thought you'd want to know

When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless

I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong into my arms
Breathless

Lay down your guns, too weak to run
Nothing can harm you here
Your precious heart, broken and scarred
Somehow you made it through
I only ask that you won't go again

When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless

I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong into my arms
Breathless, oh, breathless

So glad to see you smiling
So good to hear your laugh
I think that you've found you
Even missed yourself

I'm only asking this because
I think that truth be told
Oh, you'll never go again
Again

When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless

I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong into my arms
Breathless, breathless



Emily comes home from school,
grabs onto her daddy's hand,
he says "baby girl what's wrong with you?"
she says "please don't make me go back there again"

She said "I wish there was some way
to make them stop it"
so he drives down to
that principal's office and says

"I didn't bring her up
so they could cut her down
I didn't bring her here
so they could shut her out
I live my whole damn life
to see that little girl's smile
so why are tears pouring down
that sweet face?
she wasn't brought up that way"

Emily's home late again
he sees that boy drive away
oh, but something different this time,
she doesn't have too much to say
she said "he tried but
there's just some things I won't do"
and through the tears
she said "I couldn't do that to you"
and he said

"I didn't bring you up
so he could wear
you down
take that innocent heart
and turn it inside out
I live my whole damn life
to see my little girl's smile
so don't let nobody take that away,
you weren't brought up that way"

The phone rings on a rainy night
says "it's Officer Tate"
he said "sir, there's been an accident,
you better come down here right away,
a drunken driver missed an overpass,
and Emily, she's fading fast"
he says "God,I didn't bring her up
to watch them lay her down
nearly killed me the day
they put her
momma in the ground
only thing that kept me alive,
was that little girl's smile
so please don't take that away,
I won't be easy taking her today,
she wasn't brought up that way"

He stands over the hospital bed
Emily opens her eyes



So many bunnies on the floor tonight
Hoping and shaking their bunny hips
There's a she bunny in all of us
Ohhhhh!!
Jump on the dance floor don't be shy
Wear pant suits and send a fax
Bunny girls hop on your bunny boys
Ohhhhh whooo!!!



Well, I saw the things you were doing at the VMAs
And when I got that video award, you took the mic away
Now, I'll try to call security with every step I take
And nothing will even stop with all the music that I ever make

Don't think you're gonna win this time
'Cause you better believe that you're not what you do
I'll get ya! (yeah)
I'll get ya! (yeah)
And when I do, Kanye you'll be busted

I don't wanna be mean to you
But you better believe me when I tell you that
You are never what you do
You're busted. (Busted!)
Yeah, everybody makes mistakes
But, this is how it's gonna be until you apologize on the VMAs
You're busted!



Any day now
They're talking war
I can see the light that's in your eyes
They're not talkin
A week or two
Oh daddy can I go with you
Oh daddy can I go with you

You pack a suitcase
And take a picture from the wall
I always knew this time would come
When I ask how long
You think you're gonna be
You say "Eh, this crazy world's come undone"

Summer's over
And leaves begin to fall
And another winter's on the way
I knew I wasn't gonna take this very well
But I'd give everything to have you here today

Everyday now
They're talking war
I know this time has been
Like its never been before
We're not talking
About a week or two
Oh daddy can I go with you
Oh daddy can I go with you
Oh daddy can I go with you



And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through

[Chorus]
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
It's a revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah

So we've been outnumbered
Raided and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now
Find things they never found
They might be bigger
But we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes
Says we can beat this

[Chorus]

Tonight we'll stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight

It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah



What if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing?
Would the song still survive without five golden rings?
Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe?
What would happen if God never let it snow?
What would happen if Christmas Carols told a lie?
Tell me what would you find?

You'd say that today holds something special
Something holy and not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

What if angels did not pay attention to
All the things that we wish they would always do?
What if happiness came in a cardboard box?
Then I'd think there was something we all forgot
What would happen if presents all went away?
Tell me, what would you find?

You'd say that today holds something special
Something holy and not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

We get so caught up in all of it
Business and relationships, 100 mile an hour lives
And it's this time of year and everybody's here
It seems the last thing on your mind

It's that the day holds something special
Something holy and not superficial
So here's to Jesus Christ who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
But here's something you should know that is for sure

Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something more
There's gotta be more
There's gotta be more



Please take down the mistletoe
'Cause I don't wanna think about that right now
'Cause everything I want is miles away
In a snow covered little town

Mama's in the kitchen worrying about me
Seasons greetings hope you're well
I'm doing alright if you were wondering
Lately I can never tell

I know there shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine

I've been doing fine without you, really
Up until the nights got cold
And everybody's here except you, baby
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold

But for me it's just a lonely time
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine
Merry Christmas everybody
That'll have to be something I just say this year

Bet you got your mom another sweater
Were your cousins late again?
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands?

I know there shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when I didn't
Wonder how you are tonight
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine
You were mine



The drought was the very worst, ah ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months, and months of back and forth, ah ah
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
Hung my head, as I lost the war, and the sky turned black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean

There was nothing left to do, ah ah
When the butterflies turned to dust, they covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof, ah ah
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
I think I am finally clean, ah
Said, I think I am finally clean, ah

Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older I won't give in
Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it

The drought was the very worst, ah ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
Finally clean, think I'm finally clean, ah ah
Think I'm finally clean



You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away
No use defending words that you will never say

And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and washed them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away
No use defending words that you will never say

And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You never did give a damn thing, honey
But I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody
If I died, died for you, died for you

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Every smile you fake is so condescending
Counted all the scars you made

Now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you.



You said it in a simple way,
4 AM, the second day,
How strange that I don't know you at all.
Stumbled through the long goodbye,
One last kiss, then catch your flight,
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself don't get attached,
But in my mind I play it back,
Spinning faster than the plane that took you,

And this is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back, be here, come back, be here.
I guess you're in New York today,
I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back, be here, come back, be here.

The delicate beginning rush,
The feeling you can know so much,
Without knowing anything at all.
And now that I can put this down,
If I had known what I know now,
I never would have played so nonchalant.

Taxi cabs and busy streets,
That never bring you back to me,
I can't help but wish you took me with you,

And this is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back, be here, come back, be here.
I guess you're in London today,
And I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back, be here, come back, be here.

This is falling in love in the cruelest way,
This is falling for you and you are worlds away.

New York, be here.
But you're in London and I break down,
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around.

This is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back, be here, come back, be here.
I guess you're in New York today,
And I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back, be here, come back, be here.

I don't wanna miss you like this.
Come back, be here.
Come back, be here.



I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I don't wanna go there anymore

Talk to the wind
Talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find

I'll leave my window open
Cause I'm too tired tonight
To call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far
And I, I've got you down
I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start

Talk to yourself
Talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear

I'll leave my window open
Cause I'm too tired tonight
To call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

I've watched you so long
Screamed your name
I don't know what else I can say

But I'll leave my window open
Cause I'm too tired tonight
For all these games
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore



I've never gone with the wind, just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants
'Til you opened the door, there's so much more
I've never seen it before
I was trying to fly but I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I'm lost in your eyes
You make me crazier crazier crazier

I watched from a distance as you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes and you made me believe.

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I'm lost in your eyes
You make me crazier,crazier,crazier oh

Baby you showed me what livin' is for
I don't wanna hide anymore

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I'm, I'm lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
Crazier, crazier



Daddy,
I want you to know
How my heart aches with your loss
First your Father
Now your Mother
Lifes most precious treasure
Parents
Though they are no longer
With you on this earth
They will forever
Live in the hearts
Of all who loved them

I may not be right next to you
To tell you how much I love you
I may not be right next to you
To give you a Hug of comfort
Distance is a factor in our relationship
But you are in my thoughts
Everyday, from the moment I wake up
You are in my thoughts
You are in my heart
And you are in my prayers

I can never replace
The loss of my beloved grandparents
But as your Daughter
I will always be here for you
I am but a phone call away
And if you close your eyes and think of me
Daddy Im right beside you



He said, "I got me a nice new apartment
In a city, wouldn't you have hated that?
I'm getting by with a broken heart you left me with."
He hangs up the phone and she whispers back,

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

He was lying when he said he moved to L.A.
He's just hiding out on the other side of town
With his head in his hands and she's just 7 miles away
He's staring out the window and puts her picture down saying,

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

She almost called him on the night that he wrote
These simple words on his goodbye note

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

In dark blue Tennessee



This melody is what your love means to me
I love you so much babe can't you see
it is like a rainbow after the thunderstorm
your love aways kept me safe and warm,

You had to walk through that open door
I suddenly fell down to the floor
it hurt so much to live without you
I tried not to think about you

You were more than I ever had
my love for you still makes me glad
So please come back we could start anew
no more sitting around feeling blue

So come on, it wil be just me and you
Don't hesitate
It would be great
it's not too late
lets celebrate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps,
Praying the floor won't fall through, again
My mother accused me of losing my mind,
But I swore I was fine, you paint me a blue sky
And go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game,
But you changed the rules every day
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone
Tonight, well I stopped picking up, and this song is to let you know why

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home, I should've known

Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said "run as fast as you can"

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home

Dear John, I see it all, now it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen is too young
To be played by your dark twisted games, when I loved you so?
I should've known

You are an expert at sorry,
And keeping the lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry
Have tired, lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me,
So don't look now, I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home.

I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You should've known, you should've known
Don't you think I was too young? You should've known







She walks to school
With her arms crossed
It's just another day
At 10 o'clock she hears their screaming
Then finally she sees them
It's scary how things change
And I saw the story on the news
I saw the footage from the roof
I sat down and cried

Didn't she call you
Didn't she need you bad enough
Was there some reason
I'm not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didn't she pray too

He kissed his wife goodbye
And took the earliest flight
So he could be home that night
To put his kids to sleep
Down the aisle
Three men walked and said
We're here to die for our God
He stood up and said that's funny
Cause my God died for me
I put the magazine down
I read his words out loud
I sat down and cried

Didn't he call you
Didn't he need you bad enough
Was there some reason I'm not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didn't he pray too

The taxis pulled up
On the very day of
The rode 100 floors up
Just to come back down
They never thought they'd see the day
The the towered be up in flames
There was nothing left to say
When it all came down

And didn't they call you
Didn't they need you bad enough
Was there some reason
I'm not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
Where were you
And didn't they pray oh

I walk to school
And I wear a cross
I'm counting
Every day



You say you want to wait to get married,
why you in a pause,
you say its not your time yet,
when is the perfect time for you

just let me go, tell me im not the one for you
tell me you found someone else in your life
tell me i wasnt good enough for you
but dont tell me you want to when i dont want to anymore

what changed your mind in two days
did i do something wrong to make you put a hold
on our future,
it was just a week ago when you asked me
what date i plan to ask you the big question,
why did you do this to me

just let me go, tell me im not the one for you
tell me you found someone else in your life
tell me i wasnt good enough for you
but dont tell me you want to when i dont want to anymore

it was perfectly set how it would go down
all our dream would have come real
now you put them in a coffin and put the dirt on them
should just add a stone to them and make it read
here lies the dreams of a fallen futures,

just let me go, tell me im not the one for you
tell me you found someone else in your life
tell me i wasnt good enough for you
but dont tell me you want to when i dont want to anymore

why did yo do this
now i stand here with this ring , flowers, and dirt on my knees
tears falling down my eyes with humiliation,
it might as well just rain and have lightning strike and miss me,
tonight isnt a luck y night,

now i cant look you in the eyes any more,
just go ahead and walk away
just leave me here in my misery of shame,

just let me go, tell me im not the one for you
tell me you found someone else in your life
tell me i wasnt good enough for you
dont say you're sorry
and dont tell me you want to when i dont want to anymore

you say you want to wait to get married
you say you're not ready yet
you say today isnt good enough for you
do me a favor and do put me on hold,
because i dont want to anymore



[Spoken]
You know you guys have a lot of amazing bands from this part of the world, did you know that?

[Verse]
Well now he's back in the atmosphere
With Drops of Jupiter in his hair, hey, hey
He walks like summer and talks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey
Since his return from the stay on the moon
He listens like spring and he talks like June, hey, hey

Tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
That heaven is overrated

Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there

Well now he's back from that soul vacation
Chasing his way through the constellation, hey, hey
He checks out Mozart while he does tae-bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey

Well now he's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that he might think of me as plain old Jane
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along in the light of day
Head back to the Milky Way
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there

[Chorus]
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you, even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had and me

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along in the light of day
Head back toward the Milky Way
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself?

[Bridge]
Na na na na na na na na na na na na naaa, oh oh oh
Na na na na na na na na na na na na naaa, oh oh oh

[Chorus]
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you, even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation



Turn your dial to 93.7
Broadway acts like he's 11
Self-proclaimed, self
Worse mistake ever to land in Michigan
I'm just a singer of country songs
Just trying to play guitar and not do no wrong
But if you listen to just one thing I say

You should turn ??? 93 on
Broadway's Electric Barnyard
I sing a song called Tim McGraw
Request it and they'll play it all day long
I sing in stations all day long
But there's nothin like when you're on
The Electric Barnyard

??? from a trailer park in St. Louis
Growin' up not wearin' any shoes
Prettiest hillbilly girl you see all day
Growin' up the other trailer park girls
Couldn't hide their jealousy
Cuz she had the only phone for miles
Now she uses it as a DJ

So you should turn ?? 93 on
Broadway's Electric Barnyard
I sing a song called Tim McGraw
Request it and they'll play it all day long
I sing in stations all day long
But there's nothin like when you're on
The Electric Barnyard



There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered "have we met?"
Across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks, like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
Two a.m., who do you love?
I wonder till I'm wide awake
Now I'm pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, hey
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was, enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that this was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again
These are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you



All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now, know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago is green eyes and freckles
And your smile in the back of my mind making me feel like
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you, know you, know you

All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

And all my walls stood tall painted blue
But I'll take 'em down, take 'em down and open up the door for you

And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies the beautiful kind
Making up for lost time, taking flight, making me feel like

All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open

The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers
Just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score

Keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to breakdown
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far
But turn around (turn around), oh they've surrounded you
It's a showdown (showdown) and nobody comes to save you now
But you've got something they don't
Yeah you've got something they don't
You've just gotta keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to breakdown
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes

Keep your feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked
The night goes dark
Keep your eyes open

(Keep your ey-eyes open [4x])

Everybody's waiting for you to breakdown
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping

Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

Isn't it funny how many times we can say,
We drawn the line, cross it out, turn the page,
And moved on
That's what we thought

But here I am in the same old car,
Having myself another same old brown-eyed bar
Uh oh, uh oh,

I won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friends
We'll just drive down this road till the one we're on ends
And we'll tell each other things like I need you

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people you just come back to
So fall back on me
Fall back on you

You always let someone come in between
Your talking round the truth and never say what we mean
Look at all this wasted time

I won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friend
We'll just drive down this road and pray it doesn't end
And we'll tell each other things, like I love you

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people who you come back to
So fall back on me,
Fall back on you

Maybe we'll last
Maybe we won't
Maybe we'll stop talking and I'll haunt you like a ghost
But just, baby, get along with me

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people that you come back too
Fall back on me
Baby I'll fall back on you
Fall back on me baby,
Baby I'll fall back on you
Fall back on you

Fall back on you



You say you've turned it off
Hid your heart up on a shelf
Scared of what it might cost
To take it off for someone else
'Cause lovin him you lost
Too much of yourself
Baby can't you see that he's not me and...

I need you to know you can fall into me
That my arms are wide open
And will always be
Right here waiting, staying strong
Come and fall into me

I'll follow any road anywhere to get to you
I'll open up my soul
If that's what you need me to do
But now baby it's your move
All you've got to do
Is believe in love, just believe in us now...

I need you to know you can fall into me
That my arms are wide open
And will always be
Right here waiting, staying strong
Come and fall into me

Just believe in love
Just believe in us
Baby....

I need you to know you can fall into me
That my arms are wide open
And will always be
Right here waiting, staying strong
Come and fall into me

Come and fall into me
Baby fall into me



There's somethin' bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
Walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah

We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent mindedly makin' me want you

[Chorus]
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless

So baby drive slow
Til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now capture it remember it

[Chorus]

Well you stood there with me in the doorway
my hands shake
I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something, it's fearless.

[Chorus]



You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way

It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
"You know, I haven't seen you around before"

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out but
count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

You sit in class next to redheaded Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can

And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you feeling like flying
And your mama's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin around
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted was to be wanted
I wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now

Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind
We both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to love before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
Fifteen

la la la la la
Your very first day
Take a deep breath girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors



Someone struck a match against the night,
All I could see was you and I.
I was captivated.
A perfect little dream inside my head,
And then reality crept in, and erased it.

For a while I thought that I could hold you,
But you were just a temporary high.

Firefly you drew me to you,
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you, firefly
Firefly

Something so beautiful and free,
Was as never meant to be caged in
I thought I had you in my hand,
I tried to catch you, but I can't
Chase the wind

And just as I reach out to touch you,
I remind myself you were meant to fly.

Firefly you drew me to you,
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly

I like to think I'd be all that you wanted
Not even that is enough

Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it do you?
I wish I could keep you
I wish I could keep you, firefly
Firefly



Once upon a time, I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night, you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me

Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down
We almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened? Please tell me

'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're halfway out the door

[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure

So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence, that cuts me to the core
Where is this going? Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

[Chorus]

You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so

Oh back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always

And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it baby,
You said forever and always, yeah.

The actual name of the song is "You're still Innocent", debuted on MTV Video awards on September 12th, 2010

I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin' to get it back

Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything?
And everybody believed in you?

It's all right, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

There's some things you can't speak of
But tonight you'll live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you would sing what you know now then

Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days?
And everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep?
Before the monsters caught up to you?

It's all right, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent

It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too

Lives change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never to late to
Be brand new

It's all right, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent

It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent



Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that.

I don't even know her,
But I feel a responsibility,
To do what's upstanding and right,
It's kinda like a code, yeah,
And you've been getting closer and closer,
And crossing so many lines.

And it would be a fine proposition,
If I was a stupid girl,
But honey I am no-one's exception,
This I have previously learned.

So don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Ah ah, don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
I see you turn off your phone,
And now you got me alone,
And I say, don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that.

I just wanna make sure,
You understand perfectly,
You're the kind of man who makes me sad,
While she waits up,
You chase down the newest thing,
And take for granted what you have.

And it would be a fine proposition,
If I was a stupid girl,
And yeah I might go with it,
If I hadn't once been just like her.

Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Ah ah, don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
I see you turn off your phone,
And now you've got me alone,
And I say, don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that.

Call a cab,
Lose my number,
You're about to lose your girl,
Call a cab,
Lose my number,
Let's consider this lesson learned.

Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Ah ah, don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Wanna see you pick up your phone,
And tell her you're coming home,
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that.

It would be a fine proposition,
If I hadn't once been just like her.



7 years and 50 days, the time is passing by
Nothing in this world can be as nice as you and I
And how could we break up like this?
And how could we be wrong?
So many years, so many days and I still sing my song

Now I run to you like I always do
When I close my eyes I think of you
Such a lonely girl
Such a lonely world
When I close my eyes I dream

I return to you like I always do
When I close my eyes I think of you
Such a lonely girl
Such a lonely world
When I close my eyes I dream ' Of you

7 years and 50 days, now just look at me
Am I the girl I use to be
So damn what do you see?
And how could we break up like this?
And how could we be wrong?
So many years, so many days and I still sing my song

Now I run to you like I always do
When I close my eyes I think of you
Such a lonely girl
Such a lonely world
When I close my eyes I dream

I return to you like I always do
When I close my eyes I think of you
Such a lonely girl
Such a lonely world
When I close my eyes I dream ' Of you Go Monkey bananas ea



You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and its all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And its comin' over you like its all a big mistake

Holding my breath, won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong, you're all I wanted
Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted

Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time I'm wishin' he was you instead
Oh, oh, holding my breath, won't see you again
Something keeps me holding on to nothing

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong, you're all I wanted
Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted

I know, I know, I just know
You're not gone, you can't be gone
No

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong, won't finish what you started
Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't go back, I'm haunted

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it



Dolly Parton cover

Here you come again
Just when I've begun to get myself together
You waltz right in the door
Just like you've done before
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger
Here you come again
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
You look into my eyes
And light those dreamy eyes
And pretty soon I'm wonderin'
How I came to doubt you
All you gotta do
Is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you
And in a little while
You're messin' up my mind
And fillin' up my senses

Here you come again
Lookin' better than a body
Has a right to
And shakin' me up so
That all I really know
Is here you come again

All you gotta do
Is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you
And in a little while
You're messin' up my mind
And fillin' up my senses

Here you come again
Lookin' better than a body
Has a right to
And shakin' me up so
That all I really know
Is here you come again
here I go
and here you come again
here I go



Its too late baby
Theres no turning around
I got my hands in my pocket
And my head in the clouds
This is how I do
When I think about you
I never thought that you could break me apart
I keep a sinister smile and a whole in my heart
You wanna get inside
Then you can get in line
But not this time

Cuz you caught me off guard
Now I'm running and screaming

Will you be my hero
And I'll be your heroine
Do you know that your love
Is the sweetest sin

Oh ooh oh ooh
oh oh yeah
Oh ooh oh ooh
oh oh oh
oh ooh oh ooh
oh oh yeah



Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we would talk
And I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey Stephen, boy you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm I can't help myself

Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I've got some things to say to you
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I've never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving
I think you and I should stay the same

[Chorus]
Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm I can't help myself

They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine

Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you?

[Chorus]
Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else

I can't help myself if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm I can't help myself
myself
Mm
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
Oh, Oh,
Mm
Mm



I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York Time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light "Go"
Yeah, you skipped the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

And darling, it was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of 'I need you'
And for the first time I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

Cause darling, it was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you

It was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you



I think of you every single evening
As I lay awake at night.
I try to think; try to walk away with you...me in
And I say:

Chorus:
Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us,
Say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh,
How can you blame me,
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy,
Except you, honey baby!
Oh!

Flying high, I can see his smiling,
As we walk down by the drives.
Take my hand, take my breath away,
Cause you make me feel like flying!

Chorus:
Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us,
Say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh,
How can you blame me,
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy,
Except you, honey baby!
Oh!

Oh, you are everything I'll ever need
Oh, you are everything I wanna be!
Drive me crazy, have me baby,
All I really wanna say is:

Chorus:
Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us,
Say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh,
How can you blame me,
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy,
Oh, except you, honey baby!



Guess mine is not the first heart broken,
my eyes are not the first to cry I'm not the first to know,
there's just no gettin' over you
Hello, I'm just a fool who's willing to sit around
and wait for you
But baby can't you see, there's nothin' else
for me to do I'm hopelessly devoted to you
But now there's nowhere to hide,
since you pushed my love aside I'm not in my head,
hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you,
hopelessly devoted to you
My head is saying "fool, forget him",
my heart is saying "don't let go"
Hold on to the end, that's what I intend to do
I'm hopelessly devoted to you
But now there's nowhere to hide,
since you pushed my love aside I'm not in my head,
hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you,
hopelessly devoted to you



(Oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
(Oh oh)

Stand there like a ghost
Shaking from the rain, rain
She'll open up the door
And say, are you insane, -ane?

Say it's been a long six months (Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want (Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl

And then you say
I want you for worse or for better
I would wait for ever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait for ever and ever

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl, oh
And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl

Remind her how it used to be, be
Yeah, with pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks, cheeks
Tell her how you must've lost your mind (Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
When you left her all alone and never told her why, why (Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)

And that's how it works
That's how you lost the girl

And now you say
I want you for worse or for better
I would wait for ever and ever (Ever and ever)
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait for ever and ever

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl, oh
And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl, yeah

And you could know, oh
That I don't want you to go

Remind me how it used to be
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
And say you want me, yeah, yeah

And then you say I want you for worse or for better (Worse or for better)
I would wait for ever and ever (Ever and ever)
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait for ever and ever (I want you for ever and ever)

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl, oh
(That's how it works) And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl, oh (Get the girl)

(It's how it works) And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl, oh
And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl, oh

And that's how it works
That's how you got the girl



I bet this time of night you're still up.
I bet you're tired from a long hard week.
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city.
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me.

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you.
And I wish I could run to you.
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do,
I almost do.

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out there's no reply.
I bet it never ever occurred to you that I can't say "Hello" to you
And risk another goodbye.

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you.
And I wish I could run to you.
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do,
I almost do.

Oh, we made quite a mess, babe.
It's probably better off this way.
And I confess babe,
In my dreams you're touching my face
And asking me if I wanna try again with you.
And I almost do.

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me, not to call you.
And I wish I could run to you.
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do,
I almost do.

I bet this time of night you're still up.
I bet you're tired from a long hard week.
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city.
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me.



Wish I had concentrated
They said love was complicated
But it's something I just fell into

And it was overrated
But just look what I created
I came out alive, but I'm black and blue

But boy, you ask me if I'm all right
Think about what I had to do, yeah

Wake up and smell the break-up
Fix my heart, put on my make-up
Another mess I didn't plan

And I bet you thought you beat me
Wish you could only see
I got an 'I Heart'
Written on the back of my hand

I'd be fine if you just walked by
But you had to talk about why
You were wrong and I was right

But I can't believe you made me sit at home
Cry like a baby
Wait right by the phone every night

And now you ask about you and I
There's no you and I
Remember what you put me through
I had to

Wake up and smell the break-up
Fix my heart, put on my make-up
Another mess I didn't plan

And I bet you thought you beat me
Wish you could only see
I got an 'I Heart'
Written on the back of my hand

And when you're home all alone at night
You still wonder why
You took everything I had away

But I haven't thought about you and I
There's no you and I
And I know someday you will

Wake up and smell the break-up
Realize that we won't make-up
It didn't go the way you planned

And you'll know you didn't beat me
When you look down and see
I got an 'I Heart'
Written on the back of my hand

Written on the back of my hand
An "I Heart?"
Yeah, written on the back of my hand



Wish I had concentrated.
They said love was complicated, but it's something I just fell into.
And it was overrated, but just look what I created.
I came out alive, but I'm black and blue.
Before you ask me if I'm alright think about what I have to do...

Wake-up and smell the break up.
Fix my heart, put on my make-up.
Another mess I didn't plan.
And I'll bet you thought you beat me.
Wish you could only see I got an "I Heart ?" written on the back of my hand.

I'd be fine if you just walked by,
but you had to talk about why you were wrong and I was right.
But I can't believe you made me sit at home, cry like a baby, wait right by the phone every night.
And now you ask about you and I, there's no you and I,
remember what you put me through I had to...

Wake-up and smell the break up.
Fix my heart, put on my make-up.
Another mess I didn't plan.
And I'll bet you thought you beat me.
Wish you could only see I got an "I Heart ?" written on the back of my hand.

And when you're home all alone at night,
you'll still wonder why you took everything I had, oh baby.
I haven't thought about you and I, there's no you and I, and I know someday you will...

Wake-up and smell the break up.
Realize that we won't make up.
It didn't go the way you planned.
And you'll know you didn't beat me
when you look down and see I got an "I Heart ?" written on the back of my hand.

Written on the back of my hand.
An "I heart ?" yeah.
Written on the back of my hand...



Once upon time
A few mistakes ago
I was in your sights
You got me alone
You found me
You found me
You found me

I guess you didn't care
And I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard
You took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone
When he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
So you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies
He'll never see you cry
Pretend he doesn't know
That he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning

And I heard you moved on
From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt
Is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see
He was long gone
When he met me
And I realize the joke is on me

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

When your saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything
Yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
So you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

Trouble, trouble, trouble

Once upon a time
We broke up
The first time
You got me alone
We haven't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space
I realize the blame is on me

Cause i knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
We are never ever getting back together
We are never ever getting back together
Oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies
He'll never see you cry
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
He's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning

i knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
We are never ever getting back together
We are never ever getting back together
Oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
i used to say "never say never"
Yeah! (No!)

i knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
We are never ever getting back together
We are never ever getting back together
Oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

We are never ever getting back together
trouble, trouble, trouble

I I I I, I I I I
I I I I, I I I I
I I I I, I I I I, I I

You stand with a hand on my waist line (I I I I, I I I I)
Good to see that we're out in blank side (I I I I, I I I I)
I can hear them whisper as we pass by (I I I I, I I I I)
It's a bad sign, bad sign (I I)
Something happens when everybody finds out (I I I I, I I I I)
See the vulture circling in dark cloud (I I I I, I I I I)
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out (I I I I, I I I I)
It could burn out (I I)
'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes (I I I I, I I I I)
And guns, they are the hunters, we are the foxes (I I I I, I I I I)
And we run

Baby I know places we won't be found and they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places
I know places

Lights flash on the run for the fences (I I I I, I I I I)
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it (I I I I, I I I I)
Lose sleep, swing ship, all the damn time, not this time (I I I I, I I I I, I I)
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it (I I I I, I I I I)
My love, they are the hunters, we are the foxes (I I I I, I I I I, I I)
And we run

Baby I know places we won't be found and they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love

Baby I know places we won't be found and they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places

(I) They take their shots, we're bulletproof
I know places
(I) And you know for me it's always you
I know places
(I) In the dead of night, you act so great
I know places
(I) And I know for you it's always me
I know places

(I I I I, I I I I)
(I I I I, I I I I)



{Taylor}
I'm all alone and it's too dark
I need a man on my mark
In times like these I still need a guy
Nick you are so mine

Hey, Nick I know it's dark but I need you
I'm so alone and I'm too framed but I need you
I don't how I can be without you
I need you

{Demi}
I'm still alone inside this cage
Still need a man but it's not the same
In times like these I still need a guy
Joe you are still mine

Hey, Joe I know it's dark but I need you
I'm so alone and I'm too framed but I need you
I don't how I can be without you
I need you

Yeah, you are still mine

Hey, guys I know it's dark but I need you
I'm so alone and I'm too framed but I need you

I need you



It's 2 A.M. in your car
Windows down, you pass my street
The memories start

You say it's in the past
And drive straight ahead
You think I'm gonna hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live

And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

It's 2 A.M. in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you

We were a crooked love
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live

And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore

And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I
I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I
I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I

You always knew how to push my buttons (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
You give me everything and nothing (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
This mad, mad love makes you come rushing (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
Stay back where you stood (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)

I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)

2 A.M., here we are
See your face
Hear my voice in the dark

We were a crooked love
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live

And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live

And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore

And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

You always knew how to push my buttons (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
You give me everything and nothing (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
This mad, mad love makes you come rushing (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
Stand back where you stood (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)

I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would

I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I
I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I (I wish you would)



Throwing pennies at the fountain
But when you're standing on a mountain
It's kinda hard to aim.

Like the tree we cut our names in
There must be an explanation
Guess it didn't get enough rain.

I need reasons why you're leaving.

Well I guess I wished on a plane,
I thought it was a star.
Guess what you wrote on the paper wasn't really on your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong.

And I guess I wished on a plane,
I thought it was a star.

Diving up into the deep end
Honestly believed you'd be there
When I jumped in.

Guess it ain't your territory
We had the perfect love story
Except the ending.

Back then comes true
And it comes to you now.

And I guess I wished on a plane,
I thought it was a star.
Guess what you wrote on the paper wasn't really in your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong.

And I guess I wished on a plane,
And I thought it was a star.

And that was, it was too cloudy
It's not my fault
I just couldn't see

And I guess I wished on a plane,
I thought it was a star.
Guess what you wrote on the paper wasn't really in your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong.

And I guess I wished on a plane,
And I thought it was a star.

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Throwing pennies at the fountain
When you're standing on a mountain
It's kind of hard to aim.



I don't think that passenger seat
Has ever looked this good to me
He tells me about his night
And I count the colors in his eyes

He'll never fall in love he swears
As he runs his fingers through his hair
I'm laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke I fake a smile
That I know all his favorite songs and

I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
And if you ask me if I love him, I'd lie

He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldn't a light go on?
Doesn't he know I've had him memorized for so long?

He sees everything black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I don't let nobody see me wishing he was mine

I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
And if you ask me if I love him, I'd lie

He stands there then walks away
My God, if I could only say
I'm holding every breath for you
He'd never tell you but he can play guitar
I think he can see through everything but my heart
First thought when I wake up is, "My god, he's beautiful"
So I put on my make up and pray for a miracle

Yes, I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue oh and it kills me
His sisters beautiful he has his father's eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
If you ask me if I love him, I'd lie



Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky

And sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side

And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do

Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

Just a small town boy and girl
Living in the crazy world
Trying to figure out what is and isn't true

And I don't try to hide my tears
The secrets, or my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do

And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do

Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

When Im with anybody else
Its so hard to be myself
And only you can tell

That I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do

Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true

And I'm only me
Who I wanna be
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you
With you, uh huh hu, yeah



Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there

I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinkin' 'bout everythin' we've been through
Maybe I've been goin' back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside
'Til I came out

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Locked up in your arms and our friends were laughing
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them

Now, I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
"Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you "
Not before I knew how much I had to lose

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside
'Til I came out

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
I've be waiting for you ever since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just wanna see you back at my front door

And I say come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I locked you out
But I'd take it all back now

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside
'Til I came out

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now
Baby, what about the ending?
Oh, I thought you'd be here by now

That you'd be here by now



I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin' to get it back

Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything?
And everybody believed in you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Did some things you can't speak of
But at night you'll live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days?
And everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep?
Before the monsters caught up to you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent

It's okay, life is a tough crowd
Thirty two and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too

Lives change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to
Be brand new

It's all right, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent

It's okay, life is a tough crowd
Thirty two and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Lost your balance on a tight rope, oh
It's never too late to get it back



She can't see the way your eyes will light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare whenever she walks by
And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her
But you are everything to me

And I just want to show you, she don't even know you
She never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me but if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful, miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible, yeah

There's a fire inside of you that can't help but shine through
But she's never gonna see the light, no matter what you do
And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be

And I just want show you, she don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me but if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

Like shadows in the faded light, oh, we're invisible
I just wanna open your eyes and make you realize

And I just want to show you, she don't even know you
Baby, let me love you, let me want you
You just see right through me but if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful, miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible, oh, yeah

She can't see the way your eyes will light up when you smile



Taylor's Beyonce cover

(Spoken):
We can step it up just a little bit of a notch. We can step it up I think. And I want you to sing along. To every song that I sing that you know Please. As loud as you possibly can. I will not get offended.I think one of the cool things about being able to play guitar is that you can play whatever you want. And uh, you can play songs that you wrote or you can play songs that other people wrote or you can play country songs or you can play, you can play this.

You're irreplacable
Yeah



I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard

I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words, but all I can think is
We should be together

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa, I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me

Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'm gonna stay through it all
So jump then fall

Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me, I love each freckle on your face
Oh, I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted

I had time to think it all over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath and jump
Then fall into me

'Cause every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa, I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me

Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'm gonna stay through it all
So jump then fall

The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you, I'll catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you

The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you though the night until you smile

Whoa oh, I need you baby
Don't be afraid please
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me

Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me, too
'Cause I'm gonna stay through it all
So jump then fall

Jump then fall, baby
Jump then fall into me, into me

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine
And every time you're here, baby, I'll show you
I'll show you, you can

Jump then fall
Jump then fall
Jump then fall
Into me, into me
Yeah... oi



She didn't have a reason to go, oh no
She didn't have a reason to stay
Either way she didn't tell anyone about her first ray of sun
She looked at her keys and found a reason to run

And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
But I understand it somehow

If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies?
An unfamiliar exit sign
If I just drive on by just south of knowing why

I didn't really know her that well
But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind
She felt so out of touch, just felt too much
If you don't know what you want nothing's ever enough

And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
That's where I'm headed right now

If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies?
An unfamiliar exit sign
If I just drive on by just south of knowing why

I don't have a plan, I don't have a map
I don't even know if I'm ever going back
I don't have a when and I don't have a where
I don't even know if I'm knowing I'm there

And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
But I understand it somehow

But If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies?
An unfamiliar exit sign
If I just drive on by just south of knowing why

I just drive on by, drive on, drive on
Drive all night
If I drive on, drive on, drive on
Drive all night just south of knowing why



Kiss and tell, kiss and tell

What you waitin' for
An oppurtunity tonight.
Come on it's at your door
You're crazy if you leave it locked.
You know you gotta let it in and finally I know it too
The questions what it's always been, so what are you gonna do?
(Low) Another chance
(Low) I'll understand
(Low) If you're coming hello

Kiss and tell, kiss and tell
I'm a different girl
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell
From a different world
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell
That's what I said
Kiss and tell
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell

You procrastinate the world,
It's gonna pass you by
Already runnin' late
It's either runnin' bad or fly

You crash into the ground and have you pick yourself and laugh
You keep on shootin' for the stars
What ather choice do you have?
(Low) Another chance
(Low) I'll understand
(Low) If you're coming hello

Kiss and tell, Kiss and tell
I'm a different girl
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell
From a different world
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell
That's what I said
Kiss and tell
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell

If I ain't holdin' you back
You have your little panic attack
I, I, I did it and it's O.M.G.
I don't know what just happened to me

Kiss and tell, kiss and tell
I'm a different girl
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell
From a different world
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell
That's what I said
Kiss and...

Kiss and tell, kiss and tell
I'm a different girl
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell
From a different world
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell
That's what I said
Kiss and tell
Kiss and tell, kiss and tell, kiss and tell



Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, "I love you", I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl undercover but you tore her apart
Maybe this year, maybe this year
I'll give it to someone special

'Cause last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

And last Christmas
And this year won't be anything like
Anything like

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
And this year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special



I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go
Away
Away

I do recall now
The smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July ninth
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you missed
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I do remember
The swing in your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
I'm not much for dancing
But for you I did

Because I love your handshake
Meetin' my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is that
I don't know how to be something you miss
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines
And it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

So I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is that
I don't know how to be something you miss
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips
Just like our last



Verse 1
You see me giving people weird looks, i cant help it is ma face,
My kind is the odd and quiet type, but i can be loud when i want to,
Dont be a racist idiot, you hate the nazis too,
You're just a fat guy who needs a life, but i'm not helping that task
You tell all your friends that i am real strange,
You cant talk cos your gay,
Fat gay, fat lad, fat man, hanging on the wall,
You need give me space, ortherwise i will.... Nut you.

Chorus
You call me a phyco, you dont know what your saying,
You call me every name under the starlit sky,
Get a life, thats worth living, your making mine like hell.
Dont be gay, oops wait, your bi-sexual,
Dont be stupid and wreck your life,
Go away DJ, i aint that phyco, who nutted that lad under the old bridge,
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone!



One day break, one heart ache, every once upon a time
That black dress, happiness, bubble baths and quarter lines
They mean so much to everyone,
But you count them up one by one
Clear midnights, and his father, was thinking that your dad was ten feel tall
A blue body afraid of it, quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring
They're for the little things

Oil paintings and make it, every details turned out bad
One night stands, new romance, living for that love and person
It means so much to everyone
But you count them up one by one
Clear midnights, and his father, was thinking that your dad was ten feel tall
A blue body afraid of it, quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring
They're for the little things, oho, yeah,

No fighting, black riding, wish upon a star and give the moon a smile
Pretending, defending, take a risk and go a thought for the right
Strawberries and fairies with wings
They're for the little things,
Na na na, na na na, na na na na, uh yeah
Na na na, na na na, na na na na, oh yeah.



I said remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, "long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "this is absurd"
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, "long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, "long live the look on your face"
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Can you take a moment
Promise me this:
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children someday
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, "long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Singing long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
And long, long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered



We were both young when i first saw you
I close my eyes
and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
on a balcony in summer air

See the lights,
See the party the ball gowns

It's a love story baby just say... yes"

Oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you.



There's a little girl in this little town
With a little too much heart to go around
Live forever, never say never
You can do better, that's what she says

Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
A rabbits foot in her pocket, she dances in spite of
The fact that she's different and yet she's the same
And she says do do do do do do do do do do do do
do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do
Lucky you, lucky you
Do do do do do do do do

She sings her little song
She walks along a little
Pathway headed for the skies
Left her travels, lives they unravel
Mind over matter, that's what she says

Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
A rabbits foot in her pocket, she dances in spite of
The fact that she's different and yet she's the same
And she says do do do do do do do do do do do do
do do do do do do do do do do do do
Lucky you, lucky you, lucky you
do do do do do do do do
do do do do do do do do do do do do do do

Maybe she'll sing you do do do do
Maybe she'll bring you into the skies
Honey, she'll love you
Funny how some view
Angels above you, aint so far away

Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
A rabbits foot in her pocket, she dances in spite of
The fact that she's different and yet she's the same
And she says do do do do do do do do do do do do
do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do
Lucky you, lucky you



Your feet under the table
I love it when their touchin' mine
Your hands make the best kind of cradle
To tell me everything is fine

All I can see is you lookin' at me
Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would've stayed up
And made up you

You smile just like a picture
It doesn't even need a frame
Sometimes I wait to answer
Just to hear you say my name

And all I want is just what I've got
Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you have never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up
And made up you

I'd never let you go
Even if I could
'Cause I never could've dreamed you
Up this good

oh oh oh

Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you have never come out of the blue
I would've stayed up
And made up you

Made up you

Oh oh
Made up you



She said, 'I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights'

'And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love
And our mommas smiled and rolled their eyes'

And said, 'Oh, my, my, my'

Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you would beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did

Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I, oh, my, my, my, my

Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights

And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mommas smiled and rolled their eyes

And said, 'Oh, my, my, my'

Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two A.M, riding in your truck
And all I need is you next to me

Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
Slamming our doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside 'til the morning light, oh, my, my, my, my

A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
Then you looked at me, got down on one knee

Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mommas cried
You said, 'I do' and I did too

Take me home when we met so many years before
Where we rock our babies on the very front porch
After all this time, you and I

When I'll be 87 you'll be 89
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky, oh, my, my, my



I shined your shoes
I poured the wine
I gave you all of my time

I patched your fake smile
Against your friends
Which apparently is a crime

I gave you space
You took my place
And gave it to her

But life's too long
To waste it all loving a liar

And when love hands me matches now
I'm gonna burn it down

I keyed her car
Got my guitar
And wrote this damn song

Look what you've found
She's been around
I hear the lines long

And don't you tell me
To be nice
I'm not a nice girl

She died from complications
Of the things you told her

So when love hands me matches now
I'm gonna burn it down

Ain't it funny
You said honey
You meant sitting duck
Well i say cheater, liar, truck on fire, loser, leaver, deceiver
Just a few I've thought of

And when love hands me matches now
'Gonna burn it down
I'm gonna burn it down
Oh yeah
Gonna burn it, burn it, burn it down

Matches, now



You're on the phone with your girlfriend
She's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room
It's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do'

But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up
And find that what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you can see I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me
You belong with me

Walkin' the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey isn't this easy

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say your fine
I know you better then that
Hey what you doing with a girl like that

She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up
And find that what what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you can see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know
Baby, you belong with me
You belong with me

Oh, I remember you drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're about to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
I think I know where you belong
I think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time
How could you not know
Baby you belong with me
You belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me



You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You, have knocked me off my feet again,
Got me feeling like a nothing
You, with your voice like nails
On a chalk board, calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man

You can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

Someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down,
Try to block you out 'cause I never impress you
I just want to feel okay again

I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold but the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

Someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening, washed up and ranting
About the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean and a liar and pathetic
And alone in life and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

But someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Yeah someday I'll be big enough
So you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so (mean)
Someday I'll be living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean)

And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean)
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so mean)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?



Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of fallin'
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment, I can see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sittin', there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine

Flash forward, and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

And we got bills to pay
We got nothin' figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about

Do you remember, we were sittin' there, by the water?
You put your arm around me, for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe, for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine

Oh, oh, oh, oh

And I remember that fight, two-thirty a.m.
'Cause everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the goodbye,
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, "I'll never leave you alone"

You said, "I remember how we felt, sitting by the water.
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time.
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter.
She is the best thing that's ever been mine."

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine

Do you believe it?
We're gonna make it now
And I can see it

(I can see it now)



Taylor (spoken):
Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Hilton
Um, I met him a couple months ago
Doing a show out in California
Um and I had met him because he had said some nice things about me in a magazine and said "Ya know I'm a really big fan of Taylor Swift's music" and I read that and I'm like wow thats really cool so I had my management contact his management and he arranged to come be at one of my shows.And so, ya know, I asked him to come out and sing with me.And while he was standing there next to me on stage I said "Tyler, how would you like to be in one of my music videos?" And uh, the crowd, he was kinda silent but the crowd was like "Yeah! Oh my God!" You guys know how to do that?

Crowd:
Woo!!

Taylor (Spoken):
Thats what I like to hear. Anyways, so he's standing here on stage and I'm like straight up "Do you wanna be in a music video? I'm shooting one in a couple weeks. And uh he goes "Well, I guess. Yeah sure." Because I mean the crowd was going so loud that if he would have said no they would have probably booed him off the stage. Which was kinda my point and asking him on stage. So basically I forced him to be in my music video.Have yall seen that one? Would yall like me to bring him out and do a song with him? Tyler Hilton's in the house tonight! So uh, the song I asked to sing with him um a couple months ago when we had a show together was one that he sings on One Tree Hill. Ya see, Tyler is on the show One Tree Hill because he's cool. He was also in the movie Walk The Line, he played Elvis Presley.So I decided to go all out for my hometown. So uh, Tyler ya gonna sing a song with me?

Tyler (spoken):
Yeah
Lets do it!
If ya guys know, sing along too.

Taylor:
Everytime I think of you
I always catch my breath
I'm still standing here
And your miles away
And I wonder why you left me
And there's a storm that's raging through my frozen heart tonight

Tyler:
I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spent my time just thinkin about you
And its almost driving me wild

But its my heart thats beggin down this long distance line tonight

Both:
And I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone... Away
I ain't missin' you
No matter what I might say

Tyler:
There's a message in the wires
And I am sendin' you a signal tonight
You don't know how desperate I've become
And It looks like I'm loosein' this fight

But it's my heart that's breakin' down this long dusty road of mine

Both:
But I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone... Away
I aint missin' you at
No matter what my friends say

Taylor:
And there's a message that I'm sendin' out
Like a telograph to you or something
I can't bridge this distance
Honey, stop this heart ache all alone

Both:
I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone... Away
I ain't missin' you
No matter what my friends say
I ain't missin' you
Since you've been gone... Away
I ain't missin you
Yeah, no matter what your friends say

Hey yeah, yeah yeah yeah

I ain't missin you at all
Since you've been gone... Away
I ain't missin' you
Nooo

Taylor (Spoken):
Good Night everybody!
Woo!
woo
Ya like that girls?



I like glitter and sparkly dresses
But I'm not gonna talk about that
In my monologue
I like baking and things that smell like winter
But I'm not gonna talk about that
In my monologue

La la la,
La la la

I like writing songs about douche bags who cheat on me
But I'm not gonna say that
In my monologue
I like writing their names into songs
So that they're ashamed to go in public
But I'm not gonna say that
In my monologue

La la,
La la la la la
This is my musical monologue!

You might think I'd bring up Joe
That guy who broke up with me on the phone
But I'm not gonna mention him *rolls eyes*
In my monologue
[Spoken:]
Hey Joe, I'm doing real well
[Sings:]
Tonight I'm hosting SNL
But I'm not gonna brag about that
In my monologue

La la la,
ha ha ha,
Ha ha ha, ha ha ha, la la la

And if you're wondering if I might
Be dating the werewolf from Twilight
[mouths: "Hi Taylor!" giving a little wave and blows a kiss into the camera and a wink]
I'm not gonna comment on that
In my monologue

La la,
La la la la la
This is my musical monologue

[looks around]

You might be expecting me to say
Something bad about Kanye
And how he ran up on the stage
And ruined my VMA monologue
[Breathes and sighs...smiles]

But there's nothing more to say
'Cause everything's okay
I've got security lining the stage

It's my SNL monologue
La la,
La la la la la
This is my SNL monologue

La la,
La la la la la
That was my SNL monologue



I know we've got a lot to say
Between now and forever
But I'd be a game if you would play
And my dear you get better

All throughout the day
You smile and walk away
All I can think to do
Is follow you

If you leave I'll be crawling back for more
If you need love I'll be standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you'd be my cure

Wherever you think I am tonight
Just know we're miles from a heartbreak
Beacause in the blink of a pretty brown eye
I'll be right where you are baby

Sometime along the way you take my breath away
Distracted by he view
I fall right into you

And if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
And if you ever need love I'll be standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure

They say I need to see all the people out there waiting
But you take one look at me
And I know the mistake I'd be making

Cuz if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
And if you ever need love I'm standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you be my cure

I know we've got a lot to say between now and forever



Verse 1:
I don't want to break your heart
But you just keep on pushing me
I want to walk away
But you have ways of stopping me
I don't know what to say
Its just that I really want to leave
Cause your holding me back, holding me back from the life of luxury

Chorus:
So let me go my own way
Opposite from you
I don't care what you have to say
My hearts not in the mood
Though I really love you
You just keep hurting me
You say tell you what to do to make me happy
The only way is for you to let me leave

Verse 2:
When ever we go out
I'm just a friend to you
But when we at home
You want to call me your boo
An I hate the fact
That when she comes around you make me go away
Its like you can't make up your mind
This is all I have to say

Chorus

Bridge:
You say I can count on you
But you just playing games
An I just let it slide
When call her name
You don't get it
I'm trying so hard not to walk away
But see now I'm tired of your two faces
So I'm just going to go my own way
Chorus:
So let me go my own way ( My own way)
Opposite from you ( From you, from you, from you)
I don't care what you have to say
My hearts not in the mood ( Not in the mood)
Though I really love you
You just keep hurting me ( You just keep hurting me)
You say tell you what to do to make me happy
The only way is for you to let me leave ( Let me leave)

So let me go my own way
Opposite from you
I don't care what you have to say
My hearts not in the mood
Though I really love you
You just keep hurting me
You say tell you what to do to make me happy
The only way is for you to let me leave
Let me leave, an go my own way
Let me leave, an go my own way
Let me leave, an go my own way
Let me leave, an go my own way



On a crowded highway
Through a night alone
I was barely breathing
I was crawling home
Well, it's quite not London
Or the south of France
Or an Asian Island
Or a second chance

Going back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowin' through a valley
Watching all my life go by

You're a distant memory
You're an exit sign
I was talking crazy
On the drivers side
And I know I hurt you
But I can't confess
Was that blood or a wine stain
On your wedding dress

Going back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowing through a mountain
Watching all my life go by

Going back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
What's the use of wondering why?
Maybe I'm a storm front
Blowing through a valley
Tearing up a good July

And its safe and warm
Where nothing ever happens
Could it be so hard
To realign a star for you
Change a southern man for you

Going back to Nashville
Thinking bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowing though a valley
Tearing up a good July

I'm going back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
What's the use of wondering why?
Maybe I'm a storm front
Blowing through the valley
Tearing up a good July

Going back to Nashville

I'm going back to Nashville

Going back to Naaaaahh....

Going back to Nashville
What's the use of wondering why?



I need you now
Read letters that i wrote on the wall
And the message that i left on my car
I need you now
Words that said drowned out by the rain
Waiting there for you but you never came
My world's a little colder now
But i'm keeping warm somehow

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you, don't need you
And i waited so frustrated
Who's gonna hold you
I don't need you, don't need you now

I need you now
Words i heard you whispered to me
And we will walk you down a one-way street
You need me now
That's what you've been telling my friends
But i'd come too far to go back there again
My heart, my mind, my mother's a chain
Your mind as well forget my name

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you, don't need you
And i waited so frustrated
Who's gonna hold you
I don't need you, don't need you now

I need you now
Read letters that i wrote on the wall
And the message that i left on my car

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you, don't need you
And i waited so frustrated
Who's gonna hold you
I don't need you now

And i'm not what you want
I won't wonder where you are
I won't dream a thousand stars
I don't need you now
I don't need you by the rain
And i never heard you say
I need you, i need you
I don't need you now
Don't need you
I don't need you now



You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt.
& I got that good girl fig and a tight little skirt,
And when we go crashing down, we come back in every time.
Cause we never go out of style. Take me home.
(You got the look, you got the look)



Your little hands wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in and turn on your favorite nightlight

To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have honey
If you could stay like that

Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
No one will desert you
Just try to never grow up
Never grow up

You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out
Someday and call your own shots

But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your p.j.s getting ready for school

Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
And no one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up

Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone

So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on

Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up
Oh I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up
Could still be little
Oh I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple

Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to
Please try to never grow up
Don't you ever grow up
Just never grow up



Look at you
Look at me
Look at who
We could be

I wanna know
Who you are
What you want
From the stars

And every time I look at you
I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin
And it hits me then
I love you

And every time you look at me
I could go crazy but I don't
Say it but I won't
'Cause I'd rather be alone
Than loose you

And all I really wanna do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now but baby NEVERMIND

All the time
Everyday
There's nothing I can do baby
To make you go away

So look at you
And look at me
And look at who we could be

And every time I look at you
I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin
And it hits me then
I love you

And every time you look at me
I could go crazy but I don't
Say it but I won't
'Cause I'd rather be alone
Than loose you

And all I really wanna do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now but baby NEVERMIND

All I really wanna say is "I miss you babe"
But how could you understand?
What happens if you turn away
And everything turns blue and grey
And I just wish I told you NEVERMIND?
And I could tell you now but baby NEVERMIND.

Yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah

And I could tell you now but baby NEVERMIND

Yeah, oh yeah,

I could tell you now but baby NEVERMIND



We're all bored
We're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me mine is better
We're so young that we're on the run to ruin
We play dumb
But we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears
Of mascara in the bathroom
Honey life is just a classroom

Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like battle
But every night feels just like a dream
Baby we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby we're the new romantics
The best people in life for free

We're all here
The lights and noise are blinding
We hang back
It's all in the timing
It's poker, you can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my ace
We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up and switch up sides like a record changer
The room lurks, are terrible and cruel
Buy honey most of them are true

Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like battle
But every night feels just like a dream
Baby we're the new romantics
Come on, come on along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby we're the new romantics
The best people in life for free

So come on, come along with me
The best people in life for free

Please take my hand
And please take me dancing
And please leave me stranded it's so romantic

Cause baby I could build the castle
Out of all the brick they threw at me
And every day is like battle
But every night feels just like a dream

Cause baby I could build the castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like battle
But every night feels just like a dream
Baby we're the new romantics

We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby we're the new romantics
The best people in life for free



We're all bored
We're all so tired of everything
We wait for
Trains that just aren't coming
We show off
Our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better

But we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb
But we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears
Of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom

Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

We hang back
It's all in the timing
It's poker
He can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace

We need love
But all we want is danger
We team up
Then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors
Are terrible and cruel
But, honey most of them are true

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics

Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

So come on, come along with me
The best people in life are free

Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing and
Please leave me stranded, it's so romantic (it's so romantic)

But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free



(talking)
wow its been at least 5 years since I've seen her. pfft its hard to believe
(start singing)
I cant believe its been that long, why didnt your call, why didnt you write. was it cause of him or was it just cause you dont love me anymore. you could have found some way to contact me.
(chorus)
But i know its not my fault
once hes gone i know you'll start to come around
i know its his fault now, you should have told me sooner, i wouldnt have had to live my life this way
(sing softly)
Now that he's gone will i get to see you again

I think its gonna workout this time around

(chorus)
but i know it's not my fault
once he's gone i know youll start to come around
i know its his fault now, you should have told me sooner I wouldnt have had to live my life this way cause i know its not my fault now



She said: I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shine
In the sky, the pretty lights

And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growin up and fallin in love
And our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes
And said oh my, my, my...

Take me back to the house with the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up you were bigger than me
You never did
You never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids
You and I
Oh my my my my

Well I was sixteen when suddeny
I wasnt that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined
Like pretty lights.
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes
And said oh my, my, my

Take me back to the creek those weeks in love
Two AM ridin in your truck
And all I need
Is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very fist fight
The slammin of doors 'stead of kissin goodnight
You stayed outside
Til the morning light
Oh my, my, my, my

A few years head gone and come around
We were sittin at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me
Got down on one knee

Take me back to the time
When we walked down the aisle
The whole town came and our mamas cried
You said I do
And I did too
Took me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time
You and I

I'll be 87 youll be 89
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky
Oh my, my, my...



He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

[Chorus]
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's two a.m. and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

[Chorus]

He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating intoxicating
Complicated, got away by some mistake and now

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's two a.m. and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

And that's the way I loved you oh, oh
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you



Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behid your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky

But sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need

And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

And I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well it drives me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying to let you know
That what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

Just a small town boy and girl
Living in a crazy world
Trying to figure out what is and isn't true

And I don't try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do

And you know everything thing about me
You say that you can't live without me

And I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well it drives me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying to let you know
That what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

When I'm with anybody else
It's so hard to be myself
And only you cant tell

And I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well it drives me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying to let you know
That what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

With you
Oh oh oh
Yeah



(Spoken):
My name's Taylor Swift
This is a cover song I'm gonna sing for you
By one of my favorite bands called Better Than Ezra
And its the song called Our Last Night

We were standing in an empty room
The moonlight was falling
You were holding my hand when the car pulled up for you
And I could have spent a life with you
But those days were over
You were calling my name when your face faded from view

And wasn't it you who told me the sun would always chase the day
And wasn't it you who told me:

Angels fly in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?
And stars collide and the air's alive
Or was it just like those promises that you made
On our last night?

I remember waking up with you
The days doing nothing
You meant more to me then than I think you ever knew.
But you were gonna be a doctor, movie star
A poet at a Nobel seminar
I hope the world never tore that out of you

Cause wasn't it you who told me the sun would always chase the day
Yeah wasn't it you who told me:

Angels fly in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?
And stars collide and the air's alive
Or was it just like those promises that you made
On our last night?

And what ever happened to the things you loved
And the songs we played, and the indian days
Whatever happened to the things you gave away?
Like Harold and Maude and singing

I was waving as you drove away
The sunlight was falling
You were writing backwards in a dusty window pane

Angels fly in the air tonight
and wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?
oh oh yeah
And stars collide and the air's alive
Or was it just like those promises that you made
On our last night?
on our last night
oh oh oh oh oh



I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song"
And he said,

Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh, on the first date
Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have
And when I got home, before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said,

Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh, on the first date
Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have
And when I got home, before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is a slamming screen door
Sneaking out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone, and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late, and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs, on the first date
Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have
And when I got home, before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again, oh yeah, oh, oh, yeah

I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song



Elevator buttons and morning air,
Strangers silence makes me want to take the stairs,
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares,
But right now,
My time is theirs.

Seems like there's always
Someone who disapproves,
They'll judge it like they know about me and you,
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do,
The jury's out,
And my choice is you.

So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine,
And life makes love look hard,
The stakes are high,
The waters rough,
But this love is ours,

You never know what people have up their sleeves,
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me,
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles,
But I don't care,
'Cause right now you're mine,
And you say,

So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine,
And life makes love look hard,
The stakes are high,
The water's rough,
But this love is ours

And it's not theirs to speculate,
If it's wrong and,
Your hands are tough but they are where,
My belong in,
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you.

'Cause I love the gap between your teeth,
And I love the riddles that you speak,
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored,
'Cause my heart is yours.

So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine,
And life makes love look hard,

And don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine,
But they can't take what's ours,
They can't take what's ours,
The stakes are high,
The water's rough,
But this love is ours.



Looking at it now, it all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch, I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet, good.
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet, good.
Are we out of the woods?

Looking at it now, last December
We were built to fall apart, then fall back together
Your necklace hanging from my neck,Â 
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided (We decided)
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet, good

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet, good

Are we out of the woods?

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon
Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started crying
Baby, I did too
But when the sun came up
I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out, I said, I'm setting you free
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up
You were looking at me

You were looking at me
Oh!
You were looking at me.
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods? (I remember)
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? (Oh, I remember)

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet, good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?

If you love me then I love you
Swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough

I'd like to keep you 'till I'm old
But if I can't at least I'll know
That baby, Perfect Have I Loved

Do you remember the stupid things we used to do?
Before September stole me away from you
The time we got your truck stuck in the creek
'Cos baby, roads weren't wild enough for you and me

Sayin'

If you love me then I love you
Swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you till I'm old
But if I can't at least I'll know
That baby, Perfect Have I Loved

I used to see you by the bridge we used to cross
I found the feeling of trying to get lost
You would smile that smile that I tried so hard to forget
It's hard to douse a fire that I still haven't put out yet

And if you love me then I love you
Swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you till I'm old
But if I can't at least I'll know
That baby, Perfect Have I Loved

Love was all we knew
And faith was growing on the vines
Words were all we had
And for one Summer you were mine

Sayin'

If you love me then I love you
Swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe, this will be enough
I'd like to keep you till I'm old
But if I can't at least I'll know
That baby, Perfect Have I Loved



I know he loved you
A long time ago
I ain't jealous of you
Just thought you should know
You were never good enough for him or anything like me
So you might as well sit back 'cause I ain't tryin to show maturity

X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were makin
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart
In permanent marker

So I found that picture
Of you in that green dress
Sure had a good time
Cleanin up that mess
He found 30 of the pieces but he'll never find 'em all
Tried to tape it back together
Now he knows to keep it off the wall

X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were makin
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart
In permanent marker

Well I don't appreciate you callin him to reminisce
The only reason is you're seein just how much better off he is

X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Ohhhhhh
Just like the mark you knew you were makin
Who do you think you are
To Write on his heart

X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were makin
Who do you think you are
To Write on his heart
In permanent marker
In permanent marker
Oh
Permanent marker



State the obvious,
I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine!
I'll tell mine
You're gay

Taylor:
My daddy served in the army
When he lost his right eye
But he flew a flag out in our yard
Til the day that he died
He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister, and me
To grow up and live free

Both:
Hey
Uncle Sam put your name
At the top of his list
And the statue of Liberty
Started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly
And its gonna be hell
When you hear mother freedom
Start ringing her bell
And it'll feel like
The whole wide world
Is raining down on you
Oh brought to you courtesy
Of the red, white, and blue

Oh
Justice will be served
And the battle will rage

The U.S. of

In your ass

And its gonna be hell
When you hear mother freedom
Start ringing her bell
And it'll feel like
The whole wide world
Is raining down on you
Oh ooh
Brought to you courtesy
Of the red, white, and blue



Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Oh red
Burning red

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
Burning red
Burning it was red

Oh losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah red
We're burning red

And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
Yeah, yeah
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street

Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer
And, I had it all; I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you could say sabotage
I never saw it coming, nor would I have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever present frown is a little troubling
And, she thinks I'm psycho
'Cause I like to rhyme her name with things, but
Sophistication isn't what you wear, or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh they didn't teach you that in prep school
So it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him, but I'll always get the last word
Whoa

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

And do you still feel like you know what you're doing,
'Cause I don't think you do, oh
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause
C'mon show me how much better you are
See you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say sabotage



It's 10am, I catch the morning train,
And there you are, you smile, with a seat you've saved,
Saying "hey, i've been waiting for ya".
We'd talk about our dreams, you'd talk 'bout everything,
We'd go so loud, but we don't care,
Cause all we care is that we're having so much fun.
You'd tell me 'bout your life, you'd learn a bit 'bout mine,
And just like that I swear it's like we've known each other our whole lives.

And this moment is perfect.
Train tracks grind still everyone can hear us.
Don't you dare be quiet.
This journey's ours, yeah this journey's ours.

Lets take the ride of our lives.
This is the moment where the chemistry happens,
Yeah that special connection.
These are the days of our lives.
These are the times you'll never forget.
Never regret as long as we ride here side by side.
We can speak, we can dream,
This is our time, you and me,
Lets have the ride of our lives.

As we watch the world outside the window past,
Id pray, hoping that this moment lasts.
Its hard not to laugh out loud baby when you crack a joke.
Youve got me smiling, got me thinking that Ive got it all.
You make a promise to me; promise this will be our tradition,
Cause every time we ride together its like stranger than fiction.
I dont ever want this train ride to come to an end,
But when it does baby, we can do it all over again.

And the trains coming to a stop,
Im still so lost in you I cant bare to get off.
You kiss me on the spot.
See you tomorrow, yeah tomorrow we can



I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor
Plastic dinosaurs, I love you to the moon and back

I remember your blue eyes looking into mine like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time then jumping on me waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand
Little man, even from that moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

Chorus:
Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember the drive home when the blind hope
Turned to crying and screaming, "Why?"
Flowers piled up in the worst way
No one knows what to say about a beautiful boy who died

And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day when I kissed your face
I whispered in your ear

Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
Out of this curtained room in this hospital gray
We'll just disappear
Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
What if I kept the hand me downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
But what if the miracle was even getting one moment with you

Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I love you to the moon and back



There's a plane or a bus leaving from Dallas
I hope you're on it
If there's a train moving fast down the tracks
I hope you caught it

'Cause I swear out there ain't where
You outta be
So catch a ride or catch a cab
Don't you know that I miss you bad
But don't you walk to me

Baby run
Cut a path across the blue sky
Straight in a straight line
You can't get here fast enough
Find a truck and fire it up
Lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust
I need you in a rush
So baby run
So baby run

Oh if you aint got a suitcase
Get a box
Or an old brown paper sack
Pack it light or pack it heavy
Take a truck, take a Chevy
Baby just come back
There's a short cut to the highway out of town
Why don't ya take it
Don't let that speed limit slow ya down
Go on and break it
Baby break it

And run
Cut a path across the blue sky
Straight in a straight line
You can't get here fast enough
Find a truck and fire it up
Lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust
I need you in a rush
So baby run

Run to me
Baby run
Run to me
So baby run
Run
Oh baby run



Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds in different cities
And time, is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons, and darling they all look like me

'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, this train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up, for the life of us we can't get back

A beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic, beautiful tragic, beautiful

What we had, a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair



I remember tears streaming down your face when I said "I'll never let you go"
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said "don't leave me here alone"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

Just close your eyes, the sun is going down
You'll be alright, no one can hurt you now
Come morning light, you and I'll be safe and sound.

Don't you dare look out your window, darling everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold onto this lullaby even when the musics gone, gone

Just close your eyes, the sun is going down
You'll be alright, no one can hurt you now
Come morning light, you and I'll be safe and sound

Just close your eyes, you'll be alright
Come morning light, you and I'll be safe and sound



Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree for me
I've been an awful good girl
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, a '54 convertible too, light blue
Well, I'll wait up for you dear
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Yeah...

Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the boys that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you'll check off my Christmas list

Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot
I've been an angel all year
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa honey, there's one more thing I really do need
The deed to a platinum mine
Santa honey, so hurry down the chimney tonight.

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing, a ring
And I don't mean on the phone
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight



I stay up too late, got nothing in my brain

I go on too many dates, but I can't make 'em stay
At least that's what people say mmm, that's what people say mmm

Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

I'll never miss a beat, I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see mmm, that's what they don't see mmm
I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own), I'll make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know mmm, that's what they don't know mmm

But I keep cruising, can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music in my body saying it's gonna be alright

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play

It's strange to think the songs we used to sing,
The smiles, the flowers, everything,
Is gone.
Yesterday I found out about you,
Even now just looking at you,
Feels wrong.
You say, that you'd take it all back,
Given one chance, it was a moment of weakness,
And you said yes

You should've said no,
You should've gone home,
You should have thought twice before you let it all go.
You should've known that word 'bout what you did with her'd, get back to me.
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind,
Shouldn't be asking myself why,
You shouldn't be begging for forgivness at my feet,
You should've said no
Baby and you might still have me.

You can see that I've been cryin',
Baby you know all the right things,
To say.
But do you, honestly,
Expect me, to believe,
We could ever be the same.
You say, that the past is the past,
You need one chance, it was a moment of weakness,
And you said yes

You should've said no,
You should've gone home,
You should have thought twice before you let it all go.
You should've known that word 'bout what you did with her'd, get back to me.
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
Shouldn't be asking myself why,
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet,
You should've said no
Baby and you might still have me..

I can't resist,
Before you go tell me this,
Was it worth it,
Was she worth this.

No, no, no, no

You should've said no,
You should've gone home,
You should have thought twice before you let it all go.
You should've known that word 'bout what you did with her'd, get back to me.
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
Shouldn't be asking myself why,
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet,
You should've said no
Baby and you might still have me..



It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you feels wrong

You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes

You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
But what you did with her get back to me

And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
And baby you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same

You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes

You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
But what you did with her get back to me

And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby and you might still have me

I can't resist before you go tell me this
Was it worth it? Was she worth this?
No, no, no, no, no, no

You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
But what you did with her get back to me

And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby and you might still have me.



Silent night, holy night
All is calm and all is bright
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild

Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
Shepherd quake at the sight
Glory stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Hallelujah

Christ, the Saviour is born
Christ, our Saviour is born

Silent night, holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace

Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth

Hallelujah,Hallelujah,Hallelujah;
Christ, our Saviour is born



Let's watch the tide chase the waves onto the sand
I wonder if a broken heart feel the warmth on my hand
Don't wonder how a piece of driftwood could see more through his lifetime
Let's walk away the past through the smokey black nights

I've seen a million things
spoke a million words
now i only want to speak to you

Waiting for the words
counting every bird
there's nothing i'd rather do
on smokey black nights

Still through the haze i can make out constellations
I'll make one of you and me as we sit in the sand
And i saw that sunset gleamin as my eyes went wild
Let's walk away the past through the smokey black nights

I've played a thousand songs
sang a thousand words
now i only want to sing to you

Waited on a wire
starin at the fire
there's nothing i'd rather do
on the smokey black nights

Yeah

I've walked a thousand miles
smiled a thousand smiles
Now I only smile when I'm with you

Waiting for the words
counting every bird
there's nothing i'd rather do
on the smokey black nights

So walk with me
As the sweet wind dances
I'm writing a song for you and me
On the smokey black nights



The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless that should send me running
But I kinda know that I won't get far

And you stood there in front of me just
Close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Gimme something that'll haunt me whenever you're not around
'Cause I see, sparks fly, when you smile

My mind forgets to remind me, your a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you, imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know its no good
And I could wait patiently
But I really wish you would

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Gimme something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile

I run my fingers through your hair
And watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
Its just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow
And I'm captivated by you baby
Like a fireworks show

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Gimme something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile

When sparks fly oh baby smile
When sparks fly



The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless that should send me running
But I kinda know that I won't get far

And you stood there in front of me just
Close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down

And watch the lights go wild

When sparks fly



I am not the kind of girl,
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion,
But you are not the kind of boy,
Who should be marryin' the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends,
And her snotty little family, all dressed in pastel,
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid,
Somewhere back inside a room,
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry,
This is surely not what you thought it would be,
I lose myself in a daydream,
Where I stand and say

"Don't say yes, run away now,
I'll meet you when you're out,
Of the church at the back door,
Don't wait or say a single vow,
You need to hear me out,"
And they said, "Speak now"

Fond gestures are exchanged,
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march,
And I am hiding in the curtains,
It seems I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be,
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen,
But I know you wish it was me,
You wish it was me, don't you?

Don't say yes, run away now,
I'll meet you when you're out,
Of the church at the back door,
Don't wait or say a single vow,
You need to hear me out,
And they said, "Speak now"

Don't say yes, run away now,
I'll meet you when you're out,
Of the church at the back door,
Don't wait or say a single vow,
Your time is running out,
And they said, "Speak now"

I hear the preacher say,
"Speak now or forever hold your peace,"
There's a silence, there's my last chance,
I stand up with shaking hands,
All eyes on me,
Horrified looks from everyone in the room,
But I'm only lookin' at you

I am not the kind of girl,
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion,
But you are not the kind of boy,
Who should be marryin' the wrong girl

Don't say yes, run away now,
I'll meet you when you're out,
Of the church at the back door,
Don't wait or say a single vow,
You need to hear me out,
And they said, "Speak now"

And you say, "Let's run away now,
I'll meet you when I'm out of my tux at the back door,
Oh baby, I didn't say my vow,
So glad you were around when they said, "Speak now"



You were the guy I always dreamed of. You were the guy that I loved. But then you had to leave me.
I asked when you would call me. You replied meet me at the wildernes at nine. I went there standin waitin to see your face.... You never showed up I was there for hours, I was watin to see your face. Ill stand here for hours under this lonly spot light.
Ill wait all night till I see your face. Ohh waitin to see your face. I went to the mall with all my friends to see if you were there I saw you with another girl I didnt think to swear. I wen home crying to see if you were there If a message was left I would cry my tears.I was watin to see your face. Ill stand here for hours under this lonly spot light.
Ill wait all night till I see your face. Ohh waitin to see your face. Then I had your call for me and I saw your face lookin at me I was glad to see! We went we cried to the the wilderness---Im not alone.. Under the spot light any more.... Any more--- any more--- ANY MORE!



I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved.
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up late one night at the window,
We were seventeen and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song he was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved.
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

He said, "Look at you, worrying so much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way"
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me,
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"

Like "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh ooh he's talking crazy
Ooh ooh dancing with me
Ooh ooh we could get married
Have ten kids and teach them how to dream

Oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?



I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know, is dont let go
We are alone just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

So you were never a saint.
And I love in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain.
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild.

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worth while fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
Your'e my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good
And right and real

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is a worth while fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right



Corey's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles, it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows

There's pretty girls on every corner
That watch him as he's walking home
Saying, does he know
Will you ever know?

You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know, you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone

And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't, stay beautiful

Corey finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures with my mind
So I can save 'em for a rainy day

It's hard to make a conversation
When he's taking my breath away
I should say
'Hey, by the way'

You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know, you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone

And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't, stay beautiful

If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I'll never get to hold, at least you'll know

You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know, you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone

And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my front door
Oh, but if it don't

Will you stay beautiful
A beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful
A beautiful, beautiful?

Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful
Stay beautiful



I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn-away
But you stayed

This morning I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said "okay, let's talk."

And I said,
Stay, stay, stay
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
That took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries, and now I'm always laughin'
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to

Stay, stay, stay
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay

You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hangin' out with you, all the time
All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me I'd like to hang out with you, for my whole life

Stay, and I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is going to love me, when I get mad, mad mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay



Let me know how's it feel
To be under my skin
Wrapped around my heart
Is it like anywhere you've been?
And everything I do, I do it just for you

So why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me
Like I need you?
Why are you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy
Look what you destroyed
Stupid boy

I have been, looking in
Trying to read your mind
Give you the benefit of the doubt
Every single time
And then you walk right by
I'm screamin' out inside

Why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me
Like I need you?
Why are you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy
Look what you destroyed
Stupid boy

What happens when you wake up
And see what you've lost
Take one look at me cause
That's what it cost
I was gonna be everything you need
Cause you are everything to me

So why the hell won't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me
Like I need you?
Why are you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy
Look what you destroyed
Stupid boy

Let me know how's it feel
To be under my skin



Midnight, you come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh,
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)
I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch it go round and round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

So it goes, he can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home, lights are off he's taking off his coat (Hm yeah)
I say "I've heard that you've been out and about with some other girl"
(Some other girl)
He says "What you've heard is true but I
Can't stop thinking about you and I."
I said "I've been there too a few times"

'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (A tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go (We never go) out of style, we never go out of style

Take me home
Just take me home
Yeah just take me home, oh

(Out of style) You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style



I walk in the room there's a beautiful sunshine ray
Across the room
Then I hear the phone ring walk to it and I don't what to say
Hello, Good day
But what I do know, it that tonight is gonna be the night, when

Chorus:
He says I love you and I really care about you
When, He says he'll hold me in his arms when I'm afraid
When, I'll say, Oh, I'll say I love him too
And, I care about you, yeah this ain't no charade.
Then he'll drive me home listenin' to the radio
Then, He says he really loves me too and do anything

Oh, I walk through the door there's a beautiful moonlight shine
Across the room
I crawl into bed thinkin' what I did today
With him
But what I do know, is that, I love him too.
And the next time I see, him walking down the street (down the street)
I'll think about this time, that was as beautiful sunshine.

Oh!

Chorus:
He says I love you and I care about you
Yeah, He says he'll hold in his arms when I'm afraid.
And I'll say, I love you too, yeah, I love you
Oh, I'll say, I care about you, yeah this aint no charade
Then he'll drive me home, listenin' to the radio
Then, He says, he really loves me and he'll do anything

Bridge:
I look in his brown eyes
And I see a surprise
It's like a present that you open
Oh, and do know oh do you know
What that surprise is?
It's love.
And the next time I see him walkin' down the streets in his old white t-shirt, I'll always remember, this time, that was a beautiful as sunshine.

Ohhh ohhh ohhhh sunshine
Ohhhh ohhh ohhh sunshiiiiine
Sunshine sun sun sunshine
Was as beautiful as sunshine.

Tall, dark and super man
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me

He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say

You'll smile and say "How are you?"
And I'll say, "Just fine"
I always forget to tell you I love you
I'll love you forever

I watched Superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world
I'll be around

I watched Superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

Tall, dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday he'll take me away
And save the day, yeah

Something in his deep brown eyes has me saying
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they say

And you'll leave, got places to be
And I'll be okay
I always forget to tell you I love you
I loved you from the very first day

I watched Superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world
I'll be around

And I watched Superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't chase another girl
Don't forget, don't forget about me

I'm far away, but I'll never let you go
I'm lovestruck and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be

Right here wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you
'Cause I've loved you from the very first day

I watched Superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world
I'll be around forever and ever

I watched Superman fly away
I swear, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

Come back down



This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There ain't nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face

And I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls
In the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you

Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar

Good morning loneliness comes around when I'm not
Dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town

And I knew when I saw your face I'd be
Counting down the ways to see you
And you smile that beautiful smile and all the girls
In the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you

Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar

You played in bars, you play guitar
And I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you

Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar
Sweet, sweet superstar
Superstar



Oh Oh Oh
If i could be sweet
I would but first of all, let me say
I must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way
Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
Its your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold

If i could escape
And recreate a place that's my own world
And i could be your favorite girl
Forever, perfectly together
Now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet
If i could be sweet
Sorry, but i know I've been a real bad girl
I didn't mean for you to get hurt
Whatsoever
We can make it better
Now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet
Sweet escape, sweet escape

Oooh Ooh Oooh

You let me drown
I'm at my lowest boiling point
Come help me out
I need to get me out of this joint
Come on, lets bounce
Counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around
Let's look for some common ground
Oh baby
Times been getting a little crazy
I've been getting a little lazy
Waiting for you to come save me
I can see that you're angry
By the way that you treat me
Hopefully, you don't leave me
Wanna take you with me

If i could escape
And recreate a place that's my own world
And i could be your favorite girl
Forever, perfectly together
Now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet
If i could be sweet
Sorry, but i know I've been a real bad girl
I didn't mean for you to get hurt
Whatsoever
We can make it better
Now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet
Sweet escape, sweet escape

Oooh Ooh Oooh Ooh Oooh



Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you hear is "no"
You never saw it coming
Slipped when you started running
And now you've come undone and I, I, I, I

Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees, eh eh
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you won't remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

And there you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, I knew it all along
Your eyes' wider than distance
This life's sweeter than fiction

Just a shot, just a shot in the dark, oh oh
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now you're onto something, I, I, I say

What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

And there you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, I knew it all along
Your eyes' wider than distance
This life's sweeter than fiction

There you'll stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes' wider than distance
This life's sweeter than fiction, fiction

I'll be one of the many saying,
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I'll be one of the many saying,
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud
I'll be one of the many saying,
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I'll be one of the many saying,
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud

And when they call your name
And they put your picture in a frame
You know that I'll be there time and again
'Cause I loved you when, when you

Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was "no"
Now in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever (forever)

There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, I knew it all along
Your eyes' wider than distance
This life's sweeter than fiction

There you'll stand next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes' wider than distance
This life's sweeter than fiction, fiction

It's sweeter than fiction
It's sweeter, yeah
It's sweeter than, sweeter
Sweeter than fiction



DJ:
Hey a little bit ago we were talking about uh, songwriting and listening to songs and putting down what you feel in the song and um up next in the countdown is Taylor Swift and have you heard this song yet?

Tim McGraw:
I Have heard this song.

DJ:
Tim McGraw. And what what did you think the first time you heard it? Or how was the first time?

Tim:
It was awesome. Uh except for I didn't know if I should I should take it as a compliment or I should feel old.

DJ:
A ha ha ha

Tim:
I didn't know which one but the more, the more I hear it the more...I don't know if its true or not but I start taking it as a compliment and not that I feel that I'm old. I don't know if that's true but that's what I choose to think.

DJ:
Why don't we find out. Taylor is a compliment or uh he's old?

Taylor:
Oh its definitely a compliment. Yeah

(Laughing)

DJ:
Tim McGraw meet Taylor Swift.

Tim:
Nice-

Taylor:
Nice to meet you.

Tim:
Nice to meet you, Taylor. How you doing?

Taylor:
I'm doing great. How are you doing?

Tim:
I'm doing good. Congratulations on your record. It's doing great.

Taylor:
Thank you so much. I'm just so excited. Thank you for uh having good music and everything. I swear I'm not a stalker.

(laughing)

DJ:
Well-

Taylor:
The funny thing about this song is ya know, as a writer some of the songs that you write like 4 hours you'll do them writing a song and it'll be good and everything but, I wrote this one in literally 15 minutes and ya know I really didn't think anything about calling in Tim McGraw so. I kinda shelved it for like 3 months and never even thought that it was going to be a single. But um my label heard it and was like we're putting that out.

(laughing)

Tim:
Well I'm glad ya did cuz um it's doing well for ya.

DJ:
So I-
So I understand that you two guys have not talked.

Tim:
No.

DJ:
You haven't met.

Tim:
No.

Taylor:
No, we've never talked or met or anything.

Tim:
I sent her a message one time. I think with Entertainment Weekly or something like that. Oh I don't remember what show it was. I was doing an interview and they were going to interview Taylor the next day. So, I sent her a little message. So, I don't know if she got it or not.

Taylor:
Oh my God. They never gave that to me.

Tim:
They didn't? Ok well, there ya go. I did.

(laughing)

DJ:
So I-I

Taylor:
We've just officially never never talked or messaged or anything.

Tim:
Not at all.

DJ:
So I thought, I think it's pretty brave to put out a song called Tim McGraw without maybe talking to Tim McGraw. Did you mind?

Taylor:
It was definitely kind of a chance. Ya know I did say anything bad in the song so I was kinda thinking ya know, he wouldn't take it too bad.

Tim:
Well, thank you for that. Thank you for not saying anything bad. I'm sure there's plenty that could've been said. Tell me-

Taylor:
Could you tell Faith that I said hello?

Tim:
I sure will. I sure will. And she loves the song too by the way.

Taylor:
Oh my gosh, she's awesome.

Tim:
I agree.

DJ:
This, this...Tell me about writing a song. Um did this, did this really happen?

Taylor:
Well, yeah. I mean, I never really kinda went into this writing session on I'm gonna write a song called Tim McGraw. Um, yeah. because, that would just be weird. But um...

(laughing)

Taylor:
I actually this this is kinda strange but I actually came up with the melody and ideas for this song in math class in my freshman year of high school.

Tim:
Now I feel old.

Taylor:
And um I was sitting there and was kind of started singing it to myself and I was going through a period where I was dating this guy that was going off to college and I knew we were gonna break up. So I started to think about all the things that I knew would remind him of me. And its kinda like a given one of all my friends ya know that my favorite songs are Tim McGraw songs. They just are.

Tim:
Aww, thank you.

Taylor:
And uh, you know so I kinda just thought about that first and so it pointed to the song and just sat down at that piano and wrote it with this co-writer who was kinda wondering if I was crazy or not but it turned out alright. And ya know, the funny thing is that I shelved this song for like 3 months and never never even played it for anybody, never even demoed it. And uh, then one time I was just goofing around and played it for my record label president and he goes "well thats your first single"

(laughing)

Taylor:
And I'm like well

Tim:
Well you can write songs about me anytime, Taylor.

(laughing)

Taylor:
Thats awesome. There's a part two coming out next month.

Tim:
Alright, great.

(laughing)

Tim:
Well congratulations cuz its your first single, first top ten hit and thats pretty exciting and I know you're off to the races here. You're just doing great and uh congratulations very exciting for you.

Taylor:
Awesome, its been so exciting. Tim, when are you gonna start like bringing out opening acts again?

Tim:
Um I dont know. I don't know. We'll have to look into that.

(laughing)

Taylor:
Well I'll, I have someone who I think will be really perfect for it.

Tim:
ya do? What would-

Taylor:
Yeah.

Tim:
What would their name be?

Taylor:
Uh, um I think Taylor something.

Tim:
Something like that yeah.

Taylor:
But,

Tim:
Well I'll, I'll be more than happy to have you out with me.

Taylor:
Just consider it.

DJ:
Ah, well thats very good. You're pretty fearless Taylor Swift. I'll tell ya that.

Tim:
Right she's, she's gonna be forward this time.

DJ:
I think so. Country Countdown USA is now a booking agency as well.

Tim:
Absolutely.

DJ:
Hey Taylor, I know you're on the road, thank ya so much for joining us.

Taylor:
It was awesome and thank you. It was good to meet you Tim.

Tim:
You too. Good talking to you. Bye bye now.

Taylor:
Bye

Tim:
Good luck out there.

Taylor:
Thanks



Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it is just so funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right,
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly,
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

So I drive home alone, as I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe
Get some sleep tonight

Because he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see

I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground I see who you are

I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me then you cut me down

[Chorus]
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around
And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why

You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
Well I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh

I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around

[Chorus]

Why, do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside
Why, do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind

Well I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me then cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in

You ask me for my love then you push me around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why
Why, tell me why

I take a step back, let you go
I told you I'm not bulletproof
Now you know



(Spoken:)
This one goes out to all my fans!

I'd just like to say
How everyday
You guys make life rock
I depend on you
For your support
And what do ya know
You were always there
When I needed you
And in return I'd like to say

(Chorus:)
Thank you
For everything
I wouldn't be here without you
Thank you
I love you all
Each one another
I just wanna say
Thank you
Thank you today

I can't believe that you all
Helped me come this far
I think thats
The greatest thing ever
I couldn't ask for more
And I appreciate it

(Chorus)

Oh yeah
Thank you all



He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

[Chorus]
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's two a.m. and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

[Chorus]

He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating intoxicating
Complicated, got away by some mistake and now

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's two a.m. and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

And that's the way I loved you oh, oh
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you



I said I know
He said I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this
and I watched him go
He watched me crash to the floor
On my knees just like that

He said when can I come back
I said, that's when, when I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or stormin'
Laughing when I'm crying
That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when I never see your face
I let you in, baby that's when

I said I know
He said I did you wrong, made mistakes
Put you through all of this
'Cause I let you go, you let me think
That I'd be fine without you
Imagine that!
So baby when can I come back?
And I said, that's when, when I wake up in the morning
That's when , when it's sunny or stormin'
Laughing when I'm crying
That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when I never see your face
I let you in, baby that's when
And I said all this playing
Did you ever think of me?
And he said

that's when, when I woke up in the morning
that's when, when it's sunny or stormin'
Laughing when I was crying,
and that's when you were waiting at the front gate
that's when, when I saw youR fAce
You let me in, and baby that's when

that's when ooooooh. ooh oh ooh oh oh
I said I know
he said I need some time, need some space



I'm five years old
It's getting cold
I've got my big coat on

I hear your laugh
And look up smiling at you
I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch
And the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs
And fall asleep on the way home

I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how
My friends could be so mean
I come home crying
And you hold me tight
And grab the keys

And we drive and drive
Until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop
'Till I forgotten all their names

I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing
On the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

I have an excellent father
His strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
Inside and out he's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house
And I had space to run and I
had the best days with you

There is a video I found
From back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen
And you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships
And the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

And now I know why the all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side
Even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
Staying back and watching me shine and

I didn't know if you knew
So I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today.



I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said, "I'll never let you go"
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Don't you dare look out your window, darling,
Everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when music's gone
Gone

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh
Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh
La La (La La)
La La (La La)
Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh
Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh
La La (La La)

Just close your eyes
You'll be alright
Come morning light,
You and I'll be safe and sound...

Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh oh oh. [repeat 'til fade]



Find myself at your door,
Just like all those times before,
I'm not sure how I got there,
All roads they lead me here

I imagine you are home,
In your room, all alone,
And you open your eyes into mine,
And everything feels better,

Right before your eyes,
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why,
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this,
Put my name at the top of your list,
This is the last time I'm asking you why,
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

You find yourself at my door,
Just like all those times before,
You wear your best apology,
But I was there to watch you leave,

And all the times I let you in,
Just for you to go again,
Disappear when you come back,
Everything is better

Right before your eyes,
I'm aching, no past
Nowhere to hide,
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this,
Put my name at the top of your list,
This is the last time I'm asking you why,
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong,
This is the last time I say it's been you all along,
This is the last time I let you in my door,
This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore

Oh, oh, oh,

This is the last time I'm asking you this,
Put my name at the top of your list,
This is the last time I'm asking you why,
You break my heart in the blink of an eye

This is the last time I'm asking you this (this is the last time I'm asking you this)
Put my name at the top of your list (put my name on the top of your list)
This is the last time I'm asking you why (this is the last time I'm asking you why)
You break my heart in the blink of an eye (You break my heart)

This is the last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you this

This is the last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you this

This is the last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you this

This is the last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you this



New to town with a made up name in the Angel city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight you look like a sixties' queen

Another name goes up in lights, like diamonds in the sky

And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh

Now it's big black cars, and Riviera views,
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page

And they tell you that you're lucky
But you're so confused,
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you'll make it out alive

And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared,
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere,
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square,
And it took some time, but I understand it now

'Cause now my name is up in lights,
But I think you got it right,

Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh

Yeah they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, oh, oh

You should've been there,
Should've burst through the door,
With that 'baby I'm right here' smile,
And it would've felt like,
A million little shining stars had just aligned,
And I would've been so happy.

Christmas lights glisten,
I've got my eye on the door,
Just waiting for you to walk in,
But the time is ticking,
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory,
How you said you'd be here,
You said you'd be here.

And it was like slow motion,
Standing there in my party dress,
In red lipstick,
With no one to impress,
And they're all laughing,
As I'm looking around the room,
But there was one thing missing,
And that was the moment I knew.

And the hours pass by,
Now I just wanna be alone,
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong,
So they follow me down the hall,
And there in the bathroom,
I try not to fall apart,
And the sinking feeling starts,
As I say hopelessly,
"He said he'd be here."

And it was like slow motion,
Standing there in my party dress,
In red lipstick,
With no one to impress,
And they're all laughing,
And asking me about you,
But there was one thing missing,
And that was the moment I knew.

What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do when the one
Who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

You should've been here.
And I would've been so happy.

And it was like slow motion,
Standing there in my party dress,
In red lipstick,
With no one to impress,
And they're all standing around me singing
"Happy birthday to you",
But there was one thing missing,
And that was the moment I knew.

Ooh, I knew.
Ooh,

You called me later,
And said, "I'm sorry, I didn't make it,"
And I said, "I'm sorry too,"
And that was the moment I knew.



you're new
you're scared
you don't know what you're doing there
you don't
know what
tooo dooo to pass the time,
---------------------------------------
will you finish the rest, i'm stuck on this part!
thanks!
just saying, i'm your biggest fan and i know everyone of your songs!Thanks!



In the heat of the fight, I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying, trying to make me stay
I said this time I've had enough
And you've called a hundred times, but I'm not picking up

'Cause I'm so mad, I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

I said leave, but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you"

Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave, 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

Me and my stupid pride, sitting here alone
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door and all the things that I misread

So baby, if you know everything, tell me why you couldn't see
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me

I said leave, but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you"

Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave, 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

And I scream out the window I can't even look at you, I don't need you
But I do, I do, I do
I'll say there's nothing you can say to make this right again
I mean it, I mean it, what I mean is, what I mean is

I said leave, but baby all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you"

Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave, 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs

And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess
After everything and that little black dress
After everything, I must confess
I need you



I didn't know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason, I know
I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go

I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?

So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in

I've been to a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

You saw me there, but never knew
That I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now it's all too late so you see

You could've helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too
Late to do anything

How can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in

I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

Oh, yeah

How can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
And I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in

I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside



I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
People would say, "they're the lucky ones"

I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on

Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fall out
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up I can't break through

Now I'm standing alone In a crowded room
And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down and the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now next chapter

How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes
And trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should have held me
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down and the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now

This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you'd say you'd rather love than fight
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down and the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now, the end



He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

[Chorus]
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's two a.m. and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

[Chorus]

He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating intoxicating
Complicated, got away by some mistake and now

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's two a.m. and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

And that's the way I loved you oh, oh
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you



She acts like shes 5 years old
since its cold shes got her big coat on
I hear people laugh at her
i look up bored
and she cries and runs
We star throwing stuff at her and she tries to hide
this starts to get old
She hugs her legs
and we put her to sleep
im forced to take her home

And shes stupid to know why the trees change in the fall.
And i know that she is scared
of every little thing and all
She thinks snow whites house very near how dumb
but i know we had the worst day
ever today.

she starts acting like shes 13 and thinks everyone is mean
She starts crying
And i push her away
and cut her with my keys
and she starts to drive and drive until she found a town far enough away
And she sulks and walks and tries to forget all our names

And she know if shes ever going to finish school
And she knows shell never laugh
cause we shrunk and she grew
she dont know how lng itll take to feel okay
but she knows she had the wors day ever today

She had a bullying father
She thought she was getting stronger
Her mom beats up her little brother
inside and out hes more popular than she is
She grew up in an ugly house
and had no space to run
and she had the worst days with me

there was a video i found from back when we were three
she was trying to paint in the kitchen and she was talking to me
it was the age of teasing and bullying and throwing eggs at her window
And her dad was super dumb
and i was the most handsome boy
in the whole wide world

and now she knows why
all the trees change in the fall
and she knows i was never on her side
and always said she was wrong
and she hates me
for giving her the evil eyes
and making her feel like
she could shine
and i dont know if she knew
so im taking this chance to say
that i always have the worst days
when im with you.



Should Have Been Different But
It Wasn't Different, Was It
Same Old Story, Dear John, And So Long
Should Have Fit Like A Glove
Should Have Fit Like A Ring
Like A Diamond Ring
A Token Of True Love
Should Have All Worked Out
But It Didn't
She Should Be Here Now
But She Isn't

[Chorus:]
There's Your Trouble, There's Your Trouble
You Keep Seeing Double With The Wrong One
You Can't See I Love You, You Can't See She Doesn't
But You Just Keep Holding On
There's Your Trouble

So Now You're Thinking 'Bout
All You're Missing -- How
Deep You're Sinking, Round And Round And Dragging Down
Why Don't You Cash In Your Chips
Why Don't You Call It A Loss
Not Such A Big Loss, Chalk It Up Better Luck
Could Have Been True Love
But It Wasn't
It Should All Add Up
But It Doesn't

[Repeat Chorus]

Should Have All Worked Out
But It Didn't
She Should Be Here Now
But She Isn't

[Repeat Chorus]



they don't think our love will last.
they say we're moving much to fast
just because our love is new.
doesn't mean it can't be true.
our love is young and so are we,
i love you and you love me,
but they don't believe us,
cause' they don't know us,
they don't know us we can see,
they won't listen to you and me,
instead of trying to change our plans,
why not give us a helping hand.
just like Juliette loved romeo,
sometimes others don't always know.
but they won't help us,
cause they don't know us.

chorus

why not give us a chance and see,
just how true our love can be,
they know you and they know me,
but they don't know us,
. (music turnaround)
they say we're young and love is blind,
we should give this some more time,
did they forget they were young like us,
all we ask is a little trust.

we love each other can't they see
isn't that the way it's supposed to be.
they know you --and they know me,
but they don' know us,
music intro
i hope soon your folks and mine,
will get together and take the time,
and get to know us,
really get to know us.
why not give us a chance ' and see
just how strong our love can be.
they know you, and they know me,
but they don't know us.
ooh woo a woo owho yeah
they don't know us that's for sure ,
we're not their little children anymore.
just because our love is new,
doesn't mean it can't be true
why not give us a chance and see,
how true love is suppose to be,
they know you and they know me,
but they don't know us..
yes they know you and they know me,
but they just don't know us,



Clear blue water
High tide, came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on
And I will, skies grew darker, currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone
In silent screams, and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good
This love is bad
This love is a life back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, oh
Oh, oh

Tossing, turning, struggle through the night for someone new
And I could go on and on, on and on
Lanterns burning, flickered in the mind only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone,
Been losing grip, on sinking ships
You showed up, just in time

This love is good
This love is bad
This love is a life back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, oh

This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, oh

This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)
This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)
This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)
This love, this love, this love, this love

Your kiss, my cheek
I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost
I fell to my knees
When you're young, just to run
But you come back to what you need

This love is good
This love is bad
This love is a life back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And, this love came back to me, oh

(This love) This love that's a permanent mark
(This love) This love is glowing in the dark, oh
(This love) These hands had to let it go free
(This love) And this love came back to me, oh

This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)
This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)
This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)
This love, this love, this love, this love (This love came back to me, oh)



Hey Hey, T-Swizzle (T-Swizzle)
And T-Pizzle (T-Pizzle)

[Taylor Swift:]
I'm like 8 foot 4
Blonde hair to the floor
You shorties never thought I dreamed about rapping hardcore

Still live with my parents but I'm still a thug

Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
But that's not true, 'cause I know you

Hold on baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it
And letting go and no one knows

That you cry but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain

Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
Not his price to pay

Hold on baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it
And letting go and no one knows

That you cry but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

Hold on baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it
And letting go and no one knows

That you cry but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

You're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

Goodbye, baby
With a smile, baby, baby



Do you remember the day
I leaned up against your car
And it started rolling down the street
You screamed and ran after it
And tried to open the door
And it ran over your foot
And I was too busy laughing on the ground to see.

It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

Do you remember the time we watched Carrie
And you said it reminded you of me
And I threw the remote at you
And you said "my point exactly"
And later on that night, under the neon city lights,
You paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me.

It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

You call me lucky 'cause I lose everything
But I swear I'd be careful with it
If you gave me a ring

And it would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't play our song
I wish that pretty girls wouldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along
'Til Brad Pitt comes along
Yeah, oh oh
Until Brad Pitt comes along



He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said: "That's a lie."
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On back roads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer had gone

But when you think "Tim McGraw"
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think "that little black dress"
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

But when you think "Tim McGraw"
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think "that little black dress"
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read

Is when you think "Tim McGraw"
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think "that little black dress"
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

Oh, think of me
Mmm

You said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie."



Verse1:
You take all the words you said to her and put them up as a wall of gray,protecting yourself from the world that you believe in, i didn't know youwould be able to say all the things you did so i take them and put them up as a wall of gray, protecting myself from the world i believe in
Chorus1:
She didn't have a reason to cry like she did over you, while you ignored the world and listend to the fray,and you said you wouldn't be imbarassed if you said that word again but we both go imbarassed when we said her name
Verse2:
the words written on the wall didn't have anything against anybody, were not in a war so what are we fighting for, i don't know so just shut-up and say all the thing you've wanted to say, the page filled with words in gray and it's about you
Chorus2:
I've never been anywher cold as you,you give rainy endings to perfect days, that's why i hate you for who you are
Verse3:
If you were the only thing i needed we wouldn't be this way, so she just said everything, everybody wanted her to say,but i'm not gonna say it oh,no,no,no
Chorus3:
She didn't have a reason to cry like she did over you, you promised me everything i wanted but you gave it to everybody else instead, but you never gave us a damn thing so we cry,cry alone or is it together i don't know



Today was a fairytale, you were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand, and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale, today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale, I wore a dress
You wore a dark gray t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down whenever you're around
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there

It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile that takes me to another planet
Every move you make, everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
All that I can say is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense until the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down whenever you're around
Yeah yeah

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there

It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down whenever you're around
I can feel my heart, it's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there

It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale oh oh yeaah ohhh
Today was a fairytale



The lies are always better left unsaid
So take the photos down of the wall
There's nothing left to talk about
We're in a plane and I want out
From all these stories that people tell
Thinking back I regret never telling you how I felt
I guess it feels worse
Thinking back I regret never telling you how I felt
I guess it feels worse
When you have to pretend you lose the person that you were in life
When you're trying to fix, you never feel ecstatic and alive
Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
Now you know exactly how I feel
The truth is out and I can see what's real
There's nothing left to talk about
We're in a scene and I want out
From all these stories that people tell
Thinking back I regret never telling you how I felt
I guess it feels worse
Thinking back I regret never telling you how I felt
I guess it feels worse
When you have to pretend you lose the person that you were in life
When you're trying to fix, you never feel ecstatic and alive
Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
Tonight is our last night alone dear
When you have to pretend you lose the person that you were in life
When you're trying to fix, you never feel ecstatic and alive
Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
Tonight is our last night
Tonight is our last night
Tonight is our last night
Tonight is our last night
Tonight is our last night
Tonight is our last night



I've never gone with the windJust let it flowLet it take me where it wants to goTill you open the doorThere's so much moreI've never seen it before
I was trying to flyBut I couldn't find wings Then you came alongAnd you changed everything
You lift my feet off the groundSpin me around You make me crazier, crazierFeels like I'm falling and II'm lost in your eyesYou make me crazier, Crazier, crazier
Watched from a distance as youMade life your ownEvery sky was your own kind of blueAnd I wanted to knowHow that would feelAnd you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldn't seeYou opened my eyes and you made me believe
You lift my feet off the ground'Spin me around You make me crazier, crazier Feels like I'm falling and II'm lost in your eyesYou make me crazier, Crazier, crazier, ohh......
Baby, you showed me what living is forI don't want to hide anymore..... more....
You lift my feet off the ground,spin me around You make me crazier, crazierFeels like I'm falling and II'm lost in your eyesYou make me crazier, Crazier, crazierCrazier, crazier



Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
Till the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away,
But you're quicksand

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow,
But you're friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, and get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I would
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I, I, I I, I, I I, I, I

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, and get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I will
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it



It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, uh uh uh uh
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers uh uh uh uh
Yeaaaah
We're happy free confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines, it's time uh uh

I don't know about you but im feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me but I bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22, 22

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded too many cool kids
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming instead of sleeping
Yeaaaah
We're happy free confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks, it's time uh uh

It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news I gotta have you, I gotta have you!



You had my heart, we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines but you'll still be my star
Baby 'cause in the dark, you can't see shiny cars
That's when you need me there, with you I'll always share

Because when the sun shines we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end

Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay
Under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

Just trying to get your attention



Are you trying to make me fall?
With a face like that, baby, it won't take to long.
Keep on melting me with those eyes.
And I think in a while I'll be hypnotised,
Till you hear singing,

Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you, I love you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, come a little closer,
Ooh, ooh, i love you, I love you
And I'm down to my last breath, tryna get my heals back under my head

Maybe around somewhere around the time,
The moment I saw you,
With your hair all sticking up,
I was so caught up,
Cos baby it was damn cute,
I need you, to need me,
See the train is coming for me,
Help me, save me from this crash, at last,

Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you, I love you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, come a little closer,
Ooh, ooh, i love you, I love you
And I'm down to my last breath, tryna get my heals back under my head

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
You seem to be just to be what I've tried to find,
And your name looks so good written next to mine, next to mine,, next to mine yeah,

Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you, I love you
Ooh, ooh, I really really want you
Ooh, ooh, i love you, I love you
Ooh, oh,

Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you, I love you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, come a little closer,
Ooh, ooh, i love you, I love you
And I'm down to my last breath, tryna get my heals back under my head



I never saw it coming
the look in your eyes, showed me no surprise
you walked me to the front door and said
I love you and I'd never break your heart

you were so perfect
you really lead me on
and gave me everything i ever wanted

(Chorus:)
Going out for dinner every night
Cuddling while were watching our favorite movies
going out to the football games
and then talking till sunrise
you gave me this and put me down

I really thought we would improve
but you were the one, the one
that i fell for

(Chorus)

You were the one
that lead me on
so here i go
i hope shes worth it

(Chorus)

Oh Oh Oh
You were unperfect



Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you

Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close, I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh

In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I wanna feel you by my side, standing next to me
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

I'm caught up in you
Oh, oh, oh

But your untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close, I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, come on

In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I wanna feel you by my side, standing next to me
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

And in the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, oh, oh, oh

Like a million little stars spelling out your name
They're spelling out your name, oh

He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

[Chorus]
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's two a.m. and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

[Chorus]

He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating intoxicating
Complicated, got away by some mistake and now

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's two a.m. and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

And that's the way I loved you oh, oh
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you



I remember when we broke up, the first time
Saying, this is it, I've had enough
'Cause like we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you, said you, needed space (what?)
Then you come around again and say
Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you

Oh we called it off again last night
But oh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever, ever getting back together
We are never ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever, ever, ever getting back together

Like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me, falling for it screaming that I'm right
And you, would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Oh, you called me up again tonight
But oh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever, ever getting back together
We! Are never ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But, we are never ever, ever, ever getting back together

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh oh oh

I used to think that we were forever ever, ever
And I used to say, never say never
Huh, so he calls me up and he's like, I still love you
And I'm like I just I mean this is exhausting, you know, like
We are never getting back together like, ever

(No!) We are never ever, ever getting back together
We! Are never ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

We, are not getting back together,
We oh, not getting back together

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never ever, ever, ever getting back together

We used to walk along the street
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night
And we were happy

I do recall a good while back
We snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck
Back when I deserved it
And we were happy

When it was good baby,
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

We used to watch the sun go down
On the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And Goodbye's so much harder
'Cause we were happy

When it was good baby,
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

Oh, I hate those voices
Telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices
And that's what these tears are for
'Cause we were happy

We Were Happy

When it was good baby,
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
And you were gonna marry me
When we were happy

Yeah, We were were happy
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We Were happy



Turn WYCD on
You're on your Grunwald
Back from the Amazon
Ah huh huh

He's here with doctor Don
I heard they dropped him off
In the amazon
Ah huh huh

He caught an anaconda
Ate some piranhas
That's kinda disgusting
But whatever makes you happy
And I heard some naked boy
Showed him around
Yeah
Grunwald's back in town



Walkin' through a crowd, the village is a glow
Kaleidoscope of a loud, heart beats under coats
Everybody here wanted somethin' more
Searchin' for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said

Welcome to New York
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore
The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts and put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls

Welcome to New York
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore
The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York (New York!)
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything

Welcome to New York
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat
The lights are so bright but they never blind me
Welcome to New York
New soundtrack
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York
The lights are so bright but they never blind me
Welcome to New York
So bright, they never blind me
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Shes looking in the mirror
The moments getting nearer
She thinks about it as she walks her walk
Up and down the staircase
Makeup fresh on her face
She thinks about it as she talks her talk
School dance, first chance, always been a dreamer
Theres one guy, shes shy, sees him through the mirror
And everybody looks at her,
She thinks about it

Blue dress angel face, looking in the mirror,
Shoes,purse, hair tied back and you should see her,
Shes got her magic, floating through the air,

Peace,Love,One thing leads into another
Dream big,Aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wonderin' what to wear

She's standing in her bedroom
He'll be pullin' up soon
She thinks about it as she sees headlights
Looking out the window she's got her diary to show
That she's been waiting for this all her life
First date,can't wait
Lookin' in the mirror
Heart all wrapped up
Wait until he sees her
He's lookin' right at her
She thinks about it

Sixteen blue jeans Abercrombie t-shirt
Shoes purse hair tied back and you should see her
She's got her magic floating through the air

Peace, Love,One thing leads into another
Dream big, Aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wonderin' what to wear

The years went by
The mirror saw her cry
She got up again
She got up again
The wind blew by the small town lights
She got up again

Move out
Find out where the world can take her
Bright lights late nights livin' for the greater
Move to Paris livin' on a prayer

Peace, Love,One thing leads into another
Dream big, Aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wonderin' what to wear
Ooo Ooo
Wonderin' what to wear



I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white



Say you're sorry
That face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holding on
The days drag on
Stupid girl,
I should have known, I should have known

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you
And your white horse, to come around

Maybe I was naive,
Got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams
About you and me
Happy endings
Now I know

I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you
And your white horse, to come around

And there you are on your knees,
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry

'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And its too late for you and your white horse
Now its too late for you and your white horse, to catch me now

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now
Oh, it's too late
To catch me now



You walk in here with your guitar man
Your shiny boots and your full on band
A smile on your face, a knife in your hand
Singing songs you got memorized
With whatever talent money buys
So polished that it slips right through your hands

Don't worry yourself I ain't your competition
Don't flatter yourself that was never my intention

I wanna talk about what you are that I ain't
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you in an empty room
And who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you wanna be
And who I've always been

I walk in here with a beat up case
The same guitar I've always played
And the words I wrote down on a page
When I was 12 years old and small town raised
You tell the crowd you're paying dues
I tell them this is what I do
And it's what I put my life into
As I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume

They say life on music row is rough conditions
Oh, but the easy ride was never my ambition

I wanna talk about what you are that I ain't
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you in an empty room
And who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you wanna be
And who I've always been

Let's talk about your childhood days
You were the prom queen, I was on this stage
So where's that crown gotten you these days?
When it's me and you and the same damn games
So what've you got that I ain't?
And what do you do that I can't?
Let's put me and you in an empty room and see who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you wanna be, girl
And who I've always been



He said let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city
Away from the crowds
I thought heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall, and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins my one condition is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your wildest dreams (Ah ah)
Wildest dreams (Ah ah)

I said no one has to know what we do
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound, nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now
He's so tall, and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
But my last request it is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your wildest dreams (Ah ah) (Ah ah)
Wildest dreams (Ah ah)

You see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burn it down
Some day when you leave me
I bet these memories hunt you around
You see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burn it down (Burn it down)
Some day when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around (Follow you around)

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just pretend

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just (Just pretend, just pretend) in your wildest dreams (Ah ah)
In your wildest dreams (Ah ah)
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams (Ah ah)
In your wildest dreams (Ah ah)



Flashing lights and we, took a wrong turn and we
Fell down the rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
Spinning out of control
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds
Ooh didn't it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twisting around me
I should've slept with one eye opened at night

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever, eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better, eh
In wonderland, eh
In wonderland, eh
In wonderland, eh
In wonderland

So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed
But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams

Didn't they tell us don't rush into things
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me
Didn't you call my fears with the treacherous cat's smile
Ooh didn't it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twisting around me
It's all fun and games, still somebody loses their mind

Oh darling, we found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever, eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better, eh
In wonderland, eh
In wonderland, eh
In wonderland, eh
(In won-) In wonderland

I reach for you
But you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for something else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end in wonderland we both went mad

Oh, we found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever, eh (Last forever)
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (Got lost in it)
And life was never worse but never better, eh (Never better)
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (Wonderland)
And we pretended it could last forever, eh (In wonderland)
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (Wonderland)
And life was never worse but never better

In wonderland



I can't believe you did it again, walk by and took my heart with you
Why'd you have to look so good, don't you know I'm trying to hate you
Tryin' to have a dream without you in it, but how can I put out this fire
When you're the one that lit it?
I can't wait for the day I stop pretending that I'm really okay when I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real, until I do
I keep writing songs about you

I got a stack of papers so high and it's all about you baby
Keep thinking maybe I can make sense of something crazy
Something I can get out of my head
I write your name, I write your name, and I tear it all to shreds
I can't wait for the day I stop pretending that I'm really okay when I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real, until I do
I keep writing songs about you

And if you ever change your mind you want me back again
I hope these songs will remind me why I shouldn't let you in

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending that I'm really okay, cause I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real, till I do
I'll just wait for the day, I'll stop pretending that I'm really okay when I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real, till I do
I keep writing songs about you.



One look, dark room
Men just for you
Time moved too fast
You played it back
Buttons on a coat
Light hearted joke
No proof not much
But you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight, the light reflects
The chain on your neck
He says look up
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch
You felt enough

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out,
You are in love, true love
You are in love

Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt
He keeps his word
And for once you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kissed on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night he wakes, strange look on his face
Pauses, then says, you're my best friend
And you knew what it was, he is in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love

So it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe, go round and round
And he keeps the picture of you in his office downtown
You understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life try to put it into words

'Cause you can hear in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love
You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love



You're on the phone with your girlfriend
She's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room
It's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do'

But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up
And find that what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you can see I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me
You belong with me

Walkin' the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey isn't this easy

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say your fine
I know you better then that
Hey what you doing with a girl like that

She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up
And find that what what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you can see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know
Baby, you belong with me
You belong with me

Oh, I remember you drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're about to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
I think I know where you belong
I think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time
How could you not know
Baby you belong with me
You belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me

(Hey hey hey)
(Hey hey hey)
(Hey hey hey)
(Hey hey hey)
People like you always want back the love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed
The more I think about it now the less I know
All I know is that you drove us off the road

Stay, hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay

Here you are now, calling me up, but I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made
People like you always want back the love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye

Stay, hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay (Stay, stay, stay)

Let me remind you this was what you wanted (Oh oh oh)
You ended it
You were all I wanted (Oh oh oh)
But not like this
Not like this
Not like this
Oh, all you had to do was stay

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy (All you had to do was stay)
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay (Oh)
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay (Ooh)

You wanna dance you really wanna let it go
You want it bad but this time they told you to go
You want it

You try it fast when you really should do it slow
You got it bad and it's time I told you no
You're on it

Bad it's true, but I don't wanna know
What you had or you did
So just let it go

Oh no!

You wanna laugh and you really wanna let them know
You're so relaxed and you really gonna let it show
You want it

Do you recall when we were two of a kind
But you chose your way, and I chose mine
You're on it

Bad it's true, but I don't wanna know
What you had or you did
So just let it go

Oh no!
Remote controlled but you got it all
Oh no!
You stand ten feet tall, cause you got it all
Oh no!
Remote controlled but you got it all and you got it all
But you got it all wrong!

We had a laugh, but it turned into a cough
We got along but now I wanna get off
You're on it

I was a kid when I did what you do
I put a lid on and thought that's it, I'm through
You're on it

Bad it's true, but I don't wanna know
What you had or you did
So just let it go

Oh no!
Remote controlled but you got it all
Oh no!
You stand ten feet tall, cause you got it all
Oh no!
Remote controlled but you got it all
Oh no!
You stand ten feet tall, cause you got it all

Oh no!

And when I say you lose it, you don't believe it at all
Oh no!
It's such a long way to fall, the writings on the wall
Oh no!
But when I said you'd lose it, I can't even recall
Oh no!
If it was the best of all your brain a bit too small
Because you got it all, you got it all, you got it all
But you got it all wrong!



One look, dark room
Men just for you
Time moved too fast
You played it back
Buttons on a coat
Light hearted joke
No proof not much
But you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight, the light reflects
The chain on your neck
He says look up
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch
You felt enough

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out,
You are in love, true love
You are in love

Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt
He keeps his word
And for once you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kissed on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night he wakes, strange look on his face
Pauses, then says, you're my best friend
And you knew what it was, he is in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love

So it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe, go round and round
And he keeps the picture of you in his office downtown
You understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life try to put it into words

'Cause you can hear in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love
You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love



It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything: is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you: feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes...

[Chorus:]

You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice before you let it all go
You should've know that word, bout what you did with her
Would get back to me...
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
You should've said no, baby and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
And baby you know all the right things: to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same...
You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes...

[Repeat Chorus]

I can't resist... before you go, tell me this
Was it worth it...
Was she worth this...

No... no no no...

[Repeat Chorus]



You wake up, it's raining and it's Monday
Looks like one of those rough days
Time's up, you're late again, so get out the door
Sometimes you feel like running
Find a whole new life and jump in
Let go, get up and hit the dance floor
But when the lights go down it's the ending of the show
And you're feeling like you've got nowhere to go
Don't you know?

You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes
You can say goodbye and you can say hello
But you'll always find your way back home
You can change your style, you can change your jeans
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams
You can laugh and cry but everybody knows
You'll always find your way back home

Your best friends, your little hometown
Are waiting up wherever you go now
You know that you can always turn around
Cause this world is big and it's crazy
And this girl is thinking that maybe
This life is what some people dream about
Cause when I'm feeling down and I'm all alone
I've always got a place where I can go
Cause I know

You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes
You can say goodbye and you can say hello
But you'll always find your way back home
You can change your style, you can change your jeans
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams
You can laugh and cry but everybody knows
You'll always find your way back home

Where they know exactly who you are
Where the real you is the superstar
You know it's never too far away

You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes
You can say goodbye and you can say hello
But you'll always find your way back
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes
You can say goodbye, you can say hello
But you'll always find your way back home
You can change your style, you can change your jeans
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams
You can laugh and cry but everybody knows
You'll always find your way back home
You'll always find your way back home
You'll always find your way back home



All this time I was wasting
Hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taking me this long
Baby but I figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again
But not this time around

[Chorus]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no no, no no

Looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life
If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
Cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no no

You're not sorry, no no

You had me crawling for you honey
And it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright
But I watched all of it fade

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw there's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before you're not sorry
No, no, no

You're not sorry, no no (no)



I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin' to get it back

Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything?
And everybody believed in you?

It's all right, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent, you're still an innocent

There's some things you can't speak of
But tonight you'll live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you could see what you know now then

Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days?
And everything out of reach
Someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep?
Before the monsters caught up to you?

It's all right, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent

It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32 and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Everyone of us has messed up too

Lives change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to
Be brand new

It's all right, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent

It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

Lost your balance on a tightrope
It's never too late to get it back



I bet you lie awake at night trying to make up your sweet mind
Wonderin if you'll ever find just what you want
A hometown number one
Or a California loaded gun
But you know you'll only get one
That's what you thought
And here's what you got

I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little out of reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need
I'd give everything to be your anything
Be your anything

If you want hard to get
If you want
All you have to do is let me know
If you want a bumpy ride
Or someone with a softer side
Either one will be alright
Just let me know
Cause this is how it goes

I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little out of reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need
I'd give everything to be your anything

It's not like I'm giving up who i am for you
But with someone like you it's just so easy to do

I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little out of reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need
That's what you need

I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little out of reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need
I'd give everything to be your anything



I heard a song tonight on the radio
Another girl sings about a boy
She see his face in every space, every room
And I know that if I turn around you won't be there
If I close my eyes, will you be there?

I don't wanna lose your face
And I don't wanna wake up one day
And not remember what time erased
And I don't wanna turn around
'Cause I'm not scared of what love gave me and took away
And I don't wanna lose your face

I got a picture of you in my bedroom
And I hope it never falls
I hope I never lose that feeling
I used to get whenever you'd call
And now I wonder to myself
Who were you, where are you?
Were you ever here at all?

I don't wanna lose your face
And I don't wanna wake up one day
And not remember what time erased
And I don't wanna turn around
'Cause I'm not scared of what love gave me and took away
And I don't wanna lose your face

The girl in the song had it so good
I wish I could close my eyes and see you
I wish the sky had your face
And the oceans had your eyes
And the sunset had your lips
And I had you, oh, whoa, yeah

I don't wanna lose your face
I don't wanna wake up one day
And not remember what time erased
And I don't wanna turn around
'Cause I'm not scared of what love gave me and took away
And I don't wanna lose your face

Oh, no, no
I don't wanna lose your face
And I don't wanna turn around
Oh, oh, oh, ooh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, yeah



Your Guardian Angel

When I see your smile
Tears run down my face I can't replace
And now that I'm stronger I've figured out
How this world turns cold and breaks through my soul
And I know I'll find deep inside me I can be the one

I will never let you fall
I'll stand up with you forever
I'll be there for you through it all
Even if saving you sends me to heaven

It's ok. It's ok. It's ok.
Seasons are changing
And waves are crashing
And stars are falling all for us
Days grow longer and nights grow shorter
I can show you I'll be the one

I will never let you fall
I'll stand up with you forever
I'll be there for you through it all
Even if saving you sends me to heaven

Cuz you're my, you're my, my true love, my whole heart
Please don't throw that away
Cuz I'm here for you
Please don't walk away,
Please tell me you'll stay, stay

Use me as you will
Pull my strings just for a thrill
And I know I'll be ok
Though my skies are turning gray

I will never let you fall
I'll stand up with you forever
I'll be there for you through it all
Even if saving you sends me to heaven



All this time I was wasting
Hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taking me this long
Baby but I figured you out
